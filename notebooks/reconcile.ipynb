    "1. ‘Neutral’ policy lines (alignment set to ‘both’). My sense is this was originally a way of tagging ‘related but not directionally aligned’ votes - in practice these are ignored as part of scoring by twfy already. For tidiness, we’ll just remove all neutral lines. \n",
    "2. Out of chamber votes - public whip has no concept that a policy belongs to a chamber, and can include votes from the Lords or sometimes the Scottish Parliament. This has some effect when someone has moved from the Commons to the Lords, but is a bit difficult to explain. Twfy-v’s policies belong to one chamber - and should only contain policies related to that chamber. In the long run, we’ll want to build policies by chamber rather than putting them all in one big thing. \n",
