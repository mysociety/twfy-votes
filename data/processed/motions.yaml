  question: Question put, pursuant to Standing Order No. 23 (Motions for leave to
    bring in Bills and nomination of Select Committees at commencement of public business):—
  tidied_motion: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for civil registration
    of a relationship between two people who are cohabiting, and for such registration
    to afford certain legal rights; and for connected purposes.
  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\".321.1/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg to
    move,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".321.1/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That leave
    be given to bring in a Bill to provide for civil registration of a relationship
    between two people who are cohabiting, and for such registration to afford certain
    legal rights; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid=\".321.1/3\">The terms \"
    common law wife\" or \"common law husband\" are frequently used to describe people
    who live together. There are various urban myths about what the terms mean and
    about what rights people have over one another or over one another's property
    after they have lived together for a period of time. The time could be six months
    or two years&#8212;it all depends on what one hears. However, in British law there
    is no such person as a common law wife or husband; no legal rights or responsibilities
    are earned by people who live together in a relationship.</p><p pid=\".321.1/4\"\
    >Before Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act 1753, people's relationships could be recognised
    in several different ways, which attracted some legal and social consequences.
    One of the most widely known practices was jumping the broomstick. A couple jumped
    over a broom that was leant against their front door, thereby gaining certain
    legal rights and responsibilities. Divorce was certainly easier in those days
    because the relationship was undone by jumping back over the broom in the presence
    of witnesses. There is no indication of the means used to resolve arguments over
    the distribution of assets held in common, although probably there were no assets.</p><p
    pid=\".321.1/5\">The 1753 Act resulted in relationships being recognised by law
    when a marriage ceremony took place in a church or chapel. Subsequent legislation
    widened the measure so that non-conformist ceremonies and those held in register
    offices were accepted.</p><p pid=\".321.1/6\">What do I seek to do through the
    Bill? In July, my constituent, Rose Green, visited my advice surgery. She had
    lived with John Pendlebery for more than 12 years; they were engaged but they
    had never married&#8212;they never got around to it. They loved each other and
    saw no reason to change their situation. They expected to spend the rest of their
    lives together, but in September last year John Pendlebery died tragically and
    suddenly from a brain haemorrhage. That is when Rose found out that people who
    live together have no rights or responsibilities towards each other. She was not
    allowed to register John's death. She was not allowed to sign for his funeral.
    She even had to get his family's permission to make an entry in the book of remembrance.</p><p
    pid=\".321.1/7\">Rose said:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".321.1/8\">\"It was as
    though I didn't exist, that I had never been part of his life. It was very hurtful.
    He was my common law husband, my partner, my best friend, my soulmate. I feel
    that I am John's widow, though technically I'm not. I have no status. There's
    no word in the English language to describe what I am to John.\"</p><p pid=\"\
    .321.1/9\">That is why I seek leave to bring in the Bill, so that people like
    Rose and John who live together can have some rights and responsibilities towards
    each other.</p><p pid=\".321.1/10\">I am grateful for the support that I have
    received from the Law Society in preparing the Bill. If anyone wants to read the
    philosophical underpinning for the changes to the law that I propose, they could
    do worse than look at the report published by the Law Society in September 1999:
    \"Cohabitation proposals for reform of the law\". It can be found at <a href=\"\
    http://www.lawsoc.org.uk\">www.lawsoc.org.uk</a> under family law.</p><p pid=\"\
    .321.1/11\">I have recently been contacted by the Solicitors Family Law Association
    which also proposes that there should be a new cohabitation law, separate and
    distinct from matrimonial law. Those proposals are based on the experience of
    the association's 5,000 members in dealing with the breakdown of families, both
    married and unmarried. They are members of the legal professions who work daily
    with people in the same situation as Rose and John, their children and families.
    Members of the association say that the existing law is unclear, uncertain and
    inadequate.</p><p pid=\".321.1/12\">I am also pleased to have the support of the
    Thames Valley Police Federation. It is campaigning against inequality in the police
    pension scheme. If unmarried police officers die, their pension dies with them,
    whereas if they are married, an annual pension of one half of their final pension
    is payable to their spouse.</p><p pid=\".321.1/13\">That inequality does not affect
    only a few people, as some have suggested. A recent survey showed that 52 per
    cent. of the 6,000 employees of Thames Valley police are unmarried; 40 per cent.
    of that number have said that they have no intention to marry. That means that
    600 Thames Valley police officers, or 10 per cent. of that force's employees,
    would benefit from the Bill.</p><p pid=\".321.1/14\">I also pay tribute to WPC
    Alison Brown of Thames Valley police. Alison has been in a stable relationship
    for more than a decade and, like all Thames Valley police officers, pays 11 per
    cent. of her salary into the scheme, yet should she die her partner would not
    be looked after. Alison has been leading a campaign for a change in the police
    pension scheme.</p><p pid=\".321.1/15\">It is ironic that that situation is reflected
    throughout public sector pension schemes, while many private sector schemes recognise
    the rights of partners and allow people to nominate whoever they wish to receive
    benefits if they should die. Although I said that the situation for Thames Valley
    police is reflected throughout the public sector, that is not quite true. In July,
    hon. Members voted for our own scheme to allow pension benefits to be paid to
    unmarried partners. I supported that change and voted for it. It would be ironic
    if hon. Members opposed the Bill, thus denying others the rights we so recently
    gave ourselves. I ask hon. Members to consider how that might look outside the
    House.</p><p pid=\".321.1/16\">Can we learn from the rest of the world? Is there
    anything similar elsewhere? In some parts of the world, people are considered
    to have a de facto marriage after they have lived together for a certain period.
    That is the case in most states in Australia. I considered that option, which
    would automatically cover all people who live together, but I rejected it. It
    is important that people choose to have rights and responsibilities towards each
    other and that they opt in.</p><p pid=\".321.1/17\">If we look closer to home
    and to Europe, we see a different model of people who live together earning rights
    and responsibilities. People have to choose to opt in. The model is one of partnership
    registration, as I propose today. It already exists in Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
    Iceland, France, Germany, Belgium and the Catalonia region of Spain. Denmark has
    had a scheme for registration of partnerships since 1989, with the other countries
    following on at intervals. Virtually all our near European neighbours have introduced
    the change and the sky has not fallen in.</p><p pid=\".321.1/18\">One concern
    about the Bill is the financial implication. It would amend social security legislation
    to place registered partners in the same position as spouses and unmarried heterosexual
    partners. At present, lesbian and gay partners are treated more generously under
    social security provision, and it seems likely that the savings to the Treasury
    that such a change would involve would offset any small costs arising from changes
    to inheritance tax and pensions.</p><p pid=\".321.1/19\">I am also grateful for
    the support and help that I have had with the Bill from Stonewall and Angela Mason.
    Shortly after a piece appeared in my weekly newspaper, the <i>Reading Chronicle</i>,
    about Rose Green, the constituent I mentioned earlier, I was contacted by Ed and
    Tony who have been in a stable relationship for many years. Because he was a few
    years older than Tony, Ed was concerned about what would happen if he died first.
    I am grateful for the support that I have received from Ed and Tony in putting
    together the Bill, but they are not alone.</p><p pid=\".321.1/20\">John is in
    a seven-year relationship. With his partner, he is buying a car, and the model
    comes with a year's free insurance, but that insurance applies only to what are
    described as \"normal\" couples. Therefore, John and his partner have to decide
    who can be insured for free&#8212;the other will have to pay.</p><p pid=\".321.1/21\"\
    >Dick and Ben are in their 70s and have been together for 50 years. They have
    endured the general prejudice against the gay community, as well as some of the
    injustices that the Bill sets out to correct. They jointly own their home and
    most other assets, so they will face massive inheritance taxes that might make
    it impossible for the survivor to remain in their home.</p><p pid=\".321.1/22\"\
    >Rachel has been with her partner for 21 years, and they are life partners. Rachel
    has just been diagnosed with cancer and, because she is the breadwinner, that
    has brought home to both partners the financial, legal and other concerns that
    they have. Rachel says that the NHS has improved in its recognition of same-sex
    partners, although she has also said that one is left feeling grateful rather
    than with the feeling that one has the right to be recognised.</p><p pid=\".321.1/23\"\
    >Mark wrote to me to support the Bill. He said:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"\
    .321.1/24\">\"Many people criticise homosexual people for the alleged frequency
    and rapidity with which they change partners, yet still take the opinion that
    a measure to support enduring and meaningful gay relationships is also wrong.\"\
    </p><p pid=\".321.1/25\">I have introduced the Bill for that reason.</p><p pid=\"\

    seek the consent of the House of Commons and the House of Lords because unless
    Parliament agrees to clauses 21 to 23 and associated provisions, which relate
    to detention, the need to seek a derogation from article 5 under article 15 will
    not arise. It is therefore sensible to have the provision in place. It will fall
    automatically if Parliament does not consent to the clauses that I mentioned.</p>

    thank Members on both sides of the House who have contributed thoughtfully and
    calmly to proceedings on a difficult measure. It is difficult because we are bringing
    in the Bill in the light of what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11
    September</phrase>. It is difficult because, for any emergency measure, speed

    to make two points. First, we are engaging in the measure precisely because the
    bombings of the Tanzanian and Kenyan embassies and subsequently the attacks on
    the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon were planned years in advance. The thwarted
    attacks in Jordan and on the US embassy in Paris this year were planned months,
    if not years, in advance. Whatever is currently taking place around us&#8212;the
    network, the funding, the organisation&#8212;those who are prepared to provide

    freeing the people, in pushing the Taliban, the al-Qaeda group and bin Laden back

    pretend that because <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September</phrase>
    is 11 weeks ago, we can set it aside, are making a grave error. That is why we
    are asking the House and, subsequently, the House of Lords to take measured, proportionate
    but necessary steps to protect the people of this country. The only people who
    have anything to fear are those who bring fear and dread to others. That is why
    I move Third Reading.</p>'

    Act 1989, and that in Scotland section 36 powers are the responsibility of Scottish

    that Westminster would have the final say over approving nuclear power stations
    in Scotland; reaffirms that in all circumstances Scottish ministers accountable
    to the Scottish Parliament should have full planning powers over the siting of
    nuclear and other new power stations above 50 MW in Scotland; believes that planning
    decisions on nuclear power in Wales should be taken in accordance with the views
    of the National Assembly for Wales; and calls for the development of energy strategies
    in Scotland and Wales which make full use of indigenous energy resources, including
    gas, clean coal technology, and the enormous potential for renewable supply.

    pwmotiontext="yes">This amendment covers the definition of where a child has his
    home or is placed and responds to a point raised in Committee by <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1304" name="Robert Walter">the hon. Member for North
    Dorset (Mr. Walter)</phrase>, which I undertook at the time to consider.</p><p
    pid=".91.0/3">Clause 131 sets out the correct interpretation of various terms
    used in the Bill. Currently, subsection (2) provides that, in determining where
    a child has his home or is to be placed, any temporary absence by the child at
    school, hospital or elsewhere is to be disregarded. The hon. Member for North
    Dorset was keen to ensure that the courts could also discount temporary absences
    by the adoptive applicants in determining where a child has his home or is placed.
    We have looked at this matter, and we agree that it is important to provide the
    flexibility sought by the hon. Gentleman, to ensure that temporary absences by
    other parties, such as the adoptive applicants, could be excepted where appropriate.</p><p
    pid=".91.0/4">The advice that we have received is that the most flexible way of
    doing that would be to remove subsection (2) entirely, which would leave the question
    of where a child had his home and with whom as an issue of fact to be determined
    by the court in each case. Advice to me suggests that the current subsection (2),
    which dates from the Adoption Act 1976, is unnecessary and might indeed have a
    restrictive effect on references to a place where a child has his home that are
    not covered by the exceptions listed. That would also be a risk with any amendment
    that attempted to exclude temporary absences by the adopters on the same basis.</p><p
    pid=".91.0/5">The case law on "had his home" has it that this is a matter of fact
    to be determined in each case. It presumes regular occupation with some degree
    of permanency, but does not require continuous presence. It allows the court to
    take account of, and disregard when appropriate, any temporary absence for whatever
    reason by the child or any other party, but also enables the court to consider,
    rightly, the impact of any very lengthy absence. Government amendment No. 227
    therefore seeks to deliver the same objective as the amendments tabled by the
    hon. Gentleman in Committee, but in a more effective manner.</p><p pid=".91.0/6">On
    that basis, I hope that the House will feel able to support the amendment.</p>

    pwmotiontext="yes">We have more enthusiasm for this amendment than the Government
    had for their last amendments. It would leave out clause 101, which is the only
    clause dealing with the authority-to-carry scheme. Two provisions in the Bill
    relate to carriers' liability and involvement in immigration control. Sadly, as
    a result of the earlier guillotine, new clause 13 and Government new schedule
    2, which deal with carriers' liability, were not debated. Like me, <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1089" name="Humfrey Malins">the hon. Member for Woking
    (Mr. Malins)</phrase> regrets that, because those provisions raised substantial
    issues of interest to hon. Members and to commercial operators and their employees,
    and have been the subject of significant decisions by the courts, one of which
    resulted in the Government introducing legislation. <i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase

    hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson)</phrase> shows her assent. It is
    a great pity that the only debate we can have about carriers is on clause 101.</p>

    on Iraq passed since August 1990.</p><p pid=".265.2/5">The situation that we face
    is plainly grave. It is a matter that, across a range of beliefs, arouses great
    concern and anxiety. So in this debate I want to answer what I think are the central
    and continuing questions in people's minds. Why Iraq? Why now? Why not more time,
    more inspectors? Why a second resolution? Why not persist with the policy of containment,
    rather than contemplate military action? And finally, is not the west guilty of
    double standards, especially in relation to Israel/Palestine?</p><p pid=".265.2/6">Let
    me deal with those questions in turn. First, why Iraq? The best answer to that
    question is to be found in the 42 pages of text of the 13 Security Council resolutions
    that form the first section of the Command Paper. There we see, paragraph by paragraph,
    the exceptional danger posed by Iraq, and its continued defiance of the United
    Nations. On <phrase class="date" code="1990-08-02">2 August 1990</phrase>, resolution
    660 tells Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. On <phrase class="date" code="1990-11-29">29
    November 1990</phrase>, resolution 678 offers Iraq a "final opportunity"&#8212;interesting
    words&#8212;to comply, which it fails to take. On <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-03">3
    April 1991</phrase>, resolution 687 gives Iraq until <phrase class="date" code="1991-04-18">18
    April 1991</phrase> to make a full declaration of the "locations, amount and types"
    of all chemical and biological weapons and of all medium and long-range ballistic
    missiles. That resolution bars Iraq from ever developing biological, chemical
    or nuclear weapons.</p><p pid=".265.2/7">On and on the resolutions go. Resolution
    688 is "gravely concerned" about the repression of the civilian population in
    many parts of Iraq. In 1994, resolution 949</p><p class="indent" pid=".265.2/8">"condemns
    military deployments by Iraq in the direction of the border with Kuwait",</p><p
    pid=".265.2/9">three years after the original invasion. In 1999, nine years after
    the invasion of Kuwait, resolution 1284 establishes a further inspection regime</p><p
    class="indent" pid=".265.2/10">"as a result of Iraq's failure to implement the
    Security Council Resolutions fully".</p><p pid=".265.2/11">Iraq flatly and completely
    refuses to comply.</p><p pid=".265.2/12">Last November, resolution 1441 recognised</p><p
    class="indent" pid=".265.2/13">"the threat which Iraq's non-compliance with Council
    Resolutions and proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and long range missiles
    poses to international peace and security"&#8212;</p><p pid=".265.2/14">and gave
    Iraq its "final opportunity to comply".</p><p pid=".265.2/15">So, for the United
    Nations, the answer to the "Why Iraq?" question is very clear. Iraq is the only
    country in such serious and multiple breach of mandatory UN obligations. It is
    the only country in the world to have fired missiles at five of its neighbours,
    the only country in history to have used chemical weapons against its own people,
    and the only country in the region that has invaded two of its neighbours in recent
    years.</p>

  question: Question put, pursuant to Standing Order No. 23 (Motions for leave to
    bring in Bills and nomination of Select Committees at commencement of public business):—
  tidied_motion: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to prohibit smoking in cafés
    and restaurants; and for connected purposes.
  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid=".647.1/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="indent" pid=".647.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring
    in a Bill to prohibit smoking in caf&#233;s and restaurants; and for connected
    purposes.</p><p pid=".647.1/3">I am lucky to represent a constituency that has
    many excellent restaurants and caf&#233;s that I could commend to the House. Among
    them is the superb Friends restaurant in Pinner, where Harrow's very own celebrity
    chef, Terry Farr&#8212;featured in no less than <i>The Observer</i> food supplement&#8212;supports
    Government action to ban smoking in caf&#233;s and restaurants. Indeed, restaurants
    such as Friends, and Rules, which is already smoke free and which won this year's
    British restaurant of the year award, are one reason why London's restaurants
    are rated among the world's best.</p><p pid=".647.1/4">The one concern about London's
    restaurants is that, unlike those of California, New York, Ottawa and, soon, Dublin,
    there are no controls on whether smoking is allowed. I recognise that since 1997
    the Government have initiated a series of strong measures to begin to tackle the
    public health hazard posed by tobacco smoke. The ban on tobacco advertising, the
    White Paper "Smoking Kills", and the 42 tobacco control alliances in England that
    raise awareness and work to increase the number of smoke-free environments are
    all good examples of the work that the Government have in hand. However, I want
    my Front-Bench colleagues to go just a little further.</p><p pid=".647.1/5">Medical
    and scientific evidence confirming the health hazard of passive or second-hand
    smoke has been accepted for some time by all except those who are funded by the
    tobacco trade or who are part of it. The British Medical Association estimates
    that at least 1,000 people die from exposure to second-hand smoke each year. Evidence
    from numerous independent, authoritative studies, including one from the Government's
    science and health advisory committee, has shown that second-hand smoke is a cause
    of lung cancer, coronary heart disease and strokes in adults as well as cot death,
    middle ear disease, respiratory infections and the development of asthma in children.</p><p
    pid=".647.1/6">Just 30 minutes of exposure to second-hand smoke is enough to reduce
    blood flow to the heart. A non-smoker regularly exposed to second-hand smoke faces
    a 20 per cent. to 30 per cent. greater risk of lung cancer than a non-smoker who
    has not been similarly exposed. The most recent analysis of the impact of second-hand
    smoke on health estimates the number of annual deaths from second-hand smoke in
    the United Kingdom at 12,000&#8212;a figure comparable to that for those who died
    as a result of the great London smog 50 years ago. The figure is also greater
    than the 10,000 occupational deaths in the UK each year, and it is triple the
    3,500 annual deaths from traffic accidents.</p><p pid=".647.1/7">Increasing the
    number of smoke-free environments is clearly sensible and would protect the health
    of non-smokers. Making smoking less of a social norm can only help current and
    potential smokers to fight their addiction. The Government recognised early the
    need for action and commissioned the Health and Safety Executive to draft an approved
    code of practice on passive smoking at work. The draft code was ready for introduction
    in 1999, but it has yet to emerge into the light. The excellent Action on Smoking
    and Health and the TUC have highlighted the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act
    1974, which places a general duty of care on employers to provide a safe working
    environment for their employees. We need the Government to take further action
    through an approved code of practice or through legislation to ensure smoke-free
    workplaces if we are properly to protect those who work in the hospitality industry,
    restaurants and caf&#233;s from the dangers of second-hand smoke.</p><p pid=".647.1/8">A
    study of non-smoking employees in the hospitality industry in Australia found
    that after at least four hours work, employees had four times the carbon monoxide
    levels of workers in a smoke-free workplace. One third of those studied had carbon
    monoxide levels consistent with light smoker status. A University college London
    study in 2001 went further, showing that workers in the hospitality industry in
    London had levels of second-hand smoke seven times greater than that of the average
    English non-smoker. Similarly, a study of California bar workers showed that respiratory
    health among both smokers and non-smokers improved measurably after smoking was
    banned in Californian workplaces.</p><p pid=".647.1/9">Governments have, over
    the years, recognised the need to protect the health and safety of employees at
    work. Considerable effort has been made to deal with the risk of exposure to asbestos,
    for example. Yet second-hand smoke offers a greater threat to the health of workers
    than asbestos does. Some in the restaurant trade, already concerned about the
    impact of passive smoke, have made their restaurants smoke free, and I welcome
    that. Others who want to be smoke free worry about the proximity of competitors
    who would allow smokers, and have instead considered the option of ventilation.
    However, the evidence from America is that ventilation does not work. For that
    reason, the World Health Organisation concluded some three years ago that there
    was no safe level of exposure to second-hand smoke and that better ventilation
    on its own could not achieve a smoke-free workplace. Indeed, the current industry
    initiative&#8212;the public places charter, whose self-stated aim is to resolve
    the public smoking issue through ventilation and/or no-smoking areas&#8212;makes
    absolutely no attempt to set a level of second-hand smoke that is safe by occupational
    or environmental health standards, or a level that restaurant owners who adopt
    the charter should ensure is not breached in their premises.</p><p pid=".647.1/10">Acknowledging
    those issues, some in the hospitality industry are beginning to speak out for
    a ban. Mr. David Elliott, who is the managing director of Greene King Pub Partners,
    highlighted in December the many major cities in the world that have already established
    a smoking ban with no adverse impact on restaurant owners' incomes. He also noted
    the impact of nicotine on the fabric of business premises and speculated on the
    reduction in refurbishment and redecoration costs that a ban on smoking would
    deliver. Evidence from California shows that sales continued to increase after
    the state's ban was introduced.</p><p pid=".647.1/11">The excellent Smoke Free
    London yesterday published a MORI opinion poll showing that almost a third of
    those surveyed would be more likely to dine out more frequently if they knew that
    restaurants would be smoke-free. The poll also showed that some three quarters
    of people thought that staff working in caf&#233;s and restaurants should be able
    to work in a smoke-free environment.</p><p pid=".647.1/12">One of the more miserable
    arguments that I have heard against a ban is, and I paraphrase, that it would
    be the nanny state trampling over the rights of individuals to enjoy a smoke or
    of the individual restaurant owner to run their business in the way that they
    see fit. It is time that we recognised that second-hand smoke is now the main
    source of air pollution indoors; that it has an impact on health beyond that of
    the individual smoker; and that, given the number of deaths and diseases that
    passive smoking causes, and given the impact that second-hand smoke has on the
    health of employees, it is surely right for this state to follow the example of
    so many others and legislate for a ban. We do not allow business men and women
    to get away with other forms of pollution, and there are already many reasonable
    duties on employers to protect the health and safety of their work force. This
    issue is surely no different.</p><p pid=".647.1/13">Many MPs have campaigned successfully
    for the Government to tackle air pollution outside. Now is surely the time for
    us to take serious action on indoor air pollution. One hundred MPs from all parties&#8212;and
    I am grateful to them&#8212;have told me that they support this proposal. Some,
    such as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/717"
    name="Kevin Barron">the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron)</phrase>, my hon.
    Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1218" name="Barry
    Sheerman">the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman)</phrase> and my hon. Friend
    <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">the
    Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, have been campaigning
    hard on this issue for some time now. Countries such as France, Norway and Ireland,
    and states in America such as California, Delaware, Massachusetts and New York,
    have already taken similar steps. There must be something in a proposal that both
    American and French legislators agree on at the moment.</p><p pid=".647.1/14">A
    ban on smoking will not harm restaurant and caf&#233; owners' incomes; it may
    even increase their sales and reduce their costs. This is surely a sensible public
    health measure to protect the health of British workers and the public more generally.
    It has already been road-tested for us by a number of other countries. I commend
    the Bill to the House.</p>

  tidied_motion: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to repeal section 2 of the
    House of Lords Act 1999.
  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\".898.1/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg to
    move,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".898.1/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That leave
    be given to bring in a Bill to repeal section 2 of the House of Lords Act 1999.</p><p
    pid=\".898.1/3\">As we know, the Prime Minister and the then Conservative leader
    in the House of Lords reached a compromise whereby most of the hereditary peers
    would go and 92 would remain. That agreement cost the then Tory leader in the
    House of Lords his job; nevertheless, it formed the core of the House of Lords
    Act 1999, which contains the exemption that I am hoping to change.</p><p pid=\"\
    .898.1/4\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"1999-11-11\">11 November 1999</phrase>,
    I went along to the House of Lords with several hon. Friends to watch an historic
    occasion in which more than 640 hereditary peers were to leave the House of Lords.
    I am glad that I went to watch those proceedings on the final part of what became
    the law of the land.</p><p pid=\".898.1/5\">The purpose of the modest measure
    to which I am speaking today is that the remaining 92 hereditary peers should
    also go. It is now nearly four years since the rest went. I should point out that,
    had there been no change of Government in 1997, no change whatever would have
    taken place. The only reason for the departure of most hereditary peers is that
    Labour carried out its election manifesto. When I examined the Conservative manifesto
    for 1997, I found that, far from proposing any change to the regime of hereditary
    peers, it strongly opposed what it described as</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"\
    .898.1/6\">\"Labour's extremely damaging proposals on Lords reform\".</p><p pid=\"\
    .898.1/7\">Clearly, without the Labour Government, all hereditary peers would
    have stayed for a long time to come. Those who recall the debates on the House
    of Lords Bill 1999 in the House of Commons will also remember the strong opposition
    that came from the Conservative Benches. There was certainly no enthusiasm, to
    say the least, and at the end of the day the Conservatives tabled what could be
    described as a wrecking amendment.</p><p pid=\".898.1/8\">I realise that the remaining
    92 hereditary peers were to be kept in place until further reform of the Lords
    took place, but my point today is that, regardless of the various conflicting
    views about the composition of the House of Lords&#8212;whether it should be elected,
    appointed or, as I personally prefer, a combination of the two&#8212;the time
    has come for no hereditary peers whatever to sit in the House of Lords. I want
    to make it clear that I have no personal antagonism towards the remaining peers;
    there is no reason why I should. On some occasions, on measures such as hunting
    with dogs, we know that hereditary peers will vote in a certain way, but my concern
    today is the basic principle that, in a democracy&#8212;and certainly in the 21st
    century&#8212;no one should have a seat in Parliament simply because their ancestors
    were, for whatever reason, given a title.</p><p pid=\".898.1/9\">I found out when
    some of the titles were created. Some were conferred about 60 or 70 years ago.
    Several were conferred in the 19th century: some peers sit in the House of Lords
    because their ancestors were given a title in 1801, 1815, 1821, 1869, 1828 and
    1841. Yet they can be considered relatively recent. If we continue to examine
    the list, we find that some who sit in the House of Lords have titles going back
    to 1605, 1609, 1620, 1633 and 1660. Other titles date from the 18th century&#8212;1707,
    1711, 1728. That goes back some distance, but the list goes back even further.
    I found that one peer sits in the House of Lords on the basis of a title created
    in the 16th century; six on the basis of titles created in the 15th century; and
    two on the basis of titles created in the 14th century. It does not even end there,
    because one peer's title was created in 1283&#8212;<phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\
    1283-06-28\">28 June 1283</phrase>, to give the exact date.</p>"

    on its report. The Committee certainly had to work fast in the full glare of publicity,
    without the necessary access to intelligence papers and personnel, and it concluded,
    at paragraph 170 of its report, that the refusal by Ministers to allow such access
    hampered it in its work. Nevertheless, it has produced a useful report, while
    recognising that important questions remain unanswered. Indeed, it continues to
    ask some of those questions in the hope&#8212;I sometimes think that it is perhaps
    a vain hope&#8212;that it may still get answers to them. The Committee has not
    shied away from criticism. Indeed, the minutes of the proceedings show that the
    criticism would have been even sharper if certain amendments had been passed.
    It has done the House a service, for which I am sure that we are all grateful.</p><p
    pid=".287.3/4">On weapons of mass destruction, the Committee effectively concludes
    that, while the survey group carries out its work, the jury is still out, and
    we all need to have regard to that position. It calls for further information
    on the so-called 45-minutes claim and on Iraqi attempts to procure uranium from
    Niger, and it famously concludes that, by referring to the dodgy dossier as "further
    intelligence", the Prime Minister misrepresented its status. I am pleased to see
    that the Committee also criticised Alastair Campbell's chairing of a meeting on
    an intelligence matter.</p>

  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\".167.4/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg to
    move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p><p class=\"\" pid=\".167.4/2\"\
    \ pwmotiontext=\"yes\">A year ago, the Government published the White Paper on
    the future of higher education. It set out a wide range of proposals and, today,
    we reach the point of decision on those proposals. Our decision today in the House&#8212;the
    vote of every single Member of Parliament of every party&#8212;will determine
    the future of our universities and so determine the future ability of this country
    to prosper in the increasingly competitive global economy. In that world economy,
    the existence of the high-level intellectual and skilled talents of all our people
    will be decisive. Our success in that economy will determine the economic strength
    of this country. That was the reason for the White Paper; that is the reason for
    the Bill; and, despite all the entertainment of all the different forms of political
    speculation, we should all acknowledge today that the outcome of the debate will
    be real and substantial for this country's universities and for the future welfare
    of this country.</p><p pid=\".167.4/3\">Let me begin with some aspects of the
    Bill that have received less attention but are nevertheless important. The Bill
    will create an arts and humanities research council&#8212;the first new research
    council since 1994 and a major step forward for the arts and humanities community,
    giving those disciplines their proper status. Some might call that measure the
    revenge of the mediaeval historians.</p><p pid=\".167.4/4\">The Bill gives statutory
    underpinning to the office of the independent adjudicator, and thus provides a
    common and transparent means of redress for student complaints, in place of the
    often archaic arrangements with so-called visitors and other mechanisms&#8212;more
    appropriate to the novels of C.P. Snow than to modern university life.</p><p pid=\"\
    .167.4/5\">The Bill transfers to the National Assembly for Wales student support
    for students living in Wales, wherever they study in the United Kingdom, from
    the academic year 2006&#8211;07 onwards, together with higher education fee levels
    for higher education institutions in Wales. That will enable the National Assembly
    for Wales to create a consistent structure of policy to govern higher education
    in Wales.</p><p pid=\".167.4/6\">The Bill will simplify current arrangements for
    applications for higher education by enabling relevant information about student
    support to be shared between relevant institutions.</p><p pid=\".167.4/7\">The
    Bill has three aspects of even greater substance, which I shall now address in
    turn: first, increasing levels of funding for universities; secondly, the establishment
    of an Office for Fair Access; and, thirdly, the creation of a fairer system of
    student support.</p><p pid=\".167.4/8\">I shall deal first with university funding,
    and begin with the facts. Since 1980, academic salaries have increased by an average
    of only 20 per cent. compared with a rise in average earnings of 60 per cent.
    and of average graduate earnings by still more. The average salary of a professor
    or head of department is well below comparable salaries in both the public and
    the private sectors. At the same time, university student-staff ratios have worsened,
    from 10:1 in 1983 to 17:1 in 2001. Similar stories can be told in respect of books,
    equipment and other essentials for academic excellence. Between 1989 and 1997
    under the Conservatives, planned public funding per student fell in real terms
    by more than 36 per cent. By comparison, the United States spends 2.3 per cent
    of its gross domestic product on tertiary education institutions, whereas we spend
    just 1.1 per cent.</p><p pid=\".167.4/9\">We need to take account of the fact
    that many of the countries with which we need to compete in the global economy
    have significantly higher levels of participation in higher education than we
    do here. I cite Australia with 65 per cent., Finland with 72 per cent., Netherlands
    with 54 per cent., Norway with 62 per cent., Sweden with 69 per cent., and so
    on. The OECD average of 47 per cent is higher than the figure here. I put it to
    the House as strongly as I can that it is our bounden duty to do what we can to
    address that state of affairs. We cannot simply let it continue.</p><p pid=\"\
    .167.4/10\">Through general public spending, we have already made great steps.
    From 1997&#8211;98 to 2005&#8211;06, we have increased publicy planned spending
    on universities by a total of about &#163;2.9 billion. For the current spending
    period of 2002&#8211;03 to 2005&#8211;06, we have increased unit funding by 7
    per cent. in real terms. In the same period, capital funding for teaching and
    learning is increasing by 185 per cent., and research capital funding by 77 per
    cent.</p><p pid=\".167.4/11\">We have given and will continue to give substantial
    resources, particularly to modern universities, to widen access. For example,
    Manchester Metropolitan has received &#163;7.5 million; London Metropolitan, &#163;7.5
    million; Leeds Metropolitan, &#163;5.9 million; and so on. Continued access is
    important and we shall continue to address funding by that route.</p><p pid=\"\
    .167.4/12\">Although the lion's share of spending will always come from the public
    purse&#8212;at least under Labour, though not I think under the Conservatives&#8212;that
    will not be enough. We cannot continue to rely on the taxpayer alone to solve
    these matters. The reason is clear. There are and always will be strongly competing
    demands for public resources. The annual cost of a nursery place for a three to
    four-year-old is about &#163;1,775, or about &#163;3,550 for a four-year-old.
    The annual cost of a secondary pupil is about &#163;4,000; &#163;4,200 for a further
    education student; and about &#163;5,000 for a university student. Those are striking
    figures, and I contend that any Secretary of State looking at those figures is
    bound to say that if extra resources are available for investment, it should be
    directed at the under-fives and primary level. That is the area where we must
    target resources.</p>"

  full_motion_speech: <p pid=".859.1/1">I am giving the House the Government's estimates,
    which I hoped would be helpful even though I acknowledged that they might be subject
    to some variation. The arithmetic on which they are based means that they carry
    a certain authority.</p><p pid=".859.1/2">Understandably, much of the debate has
    centred on the circumstances of those workers who are in very great difficulties
    at present. Notable among the speeches on this subject were the ones made by my
    hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff, West and for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Mr.
    Wyatt). Both contributions offered well informed and passionate arguments in favour
    of the Government's proposals. However, the House will understand that I am not
    in a position to add to what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said
    earlier about this very important matter.</p><p pid=".859.1/3">In Standing Committee,
    we will need to talk about the pensions regulator, which in many respects will
    be as important as the PPF. The regulator will be flexible and proactive. It will
    have a light touch with schemes that are in good shape, but real teeth for schemes
    that are not. There will be simplification, and I look forward to talking about
    that, and our proposals on limited price indexation, in Committee.</p><p pid=".859.1/4">I
    am pleased that Liberal Democrat Members support the Bill, and I am sure that
    their reasoned amendments will be discussed in Committee. However, I simply do
    not understand the position adopted by Her Majesty's loyal Opposition. In an extraordinary
    statement, they have just told the House that they will not vote against the Bill,
    even though they have tabled a so-called reasoned amendment that begins by stating
    that</p><p class="indent" pid=".859.1/5">"this House declines to give a Second
    Reading to the Pensions Bill".</p><p pid=".859.1/6">The Opposition have brought
    to the House proposals that they have sketched on the back of an envelope. They
    pretend that they are working up a scheme to help today's workers, but decline
    to give a Second Reading to a Bill that will set up a pension protection fund
    that will help more than 10 million people in the future. We estimate that that
    total will include 15,000 to 16,000 people in the average parliamentary constituency.</p><p
    pid=".859.1/7">That is simply not credible. Opposition Front-Bench Members tell
    their colleagues to vote for their reasoned amendment, which would decline to
    give the Bill a Second Reading, and the shadow Secretary of State&#8212;which
    is what he will remain&#8212;will lead his confused troops into the appropriate
    Lobby. However, Opposition Members will be told later to support the Bill.</p><p
    pid=".859.1/8">The Government have the proposals for the future. Her Majesty's
    Opposition are in a total shambles. They are an example of opportunism at its
    very worst.</p><p pid=".859.1/9"><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:&#8212;</p><p

  question: Question put, That the original words stand part of the Question:—
  tidied_motion: That this House believes that all advice prepared by the Attorney-General
    on the legality of the war in Iraq should be published in full.
  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\".1399.1/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg
    to move,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this
    House believes that all advice prepared by the Attorney-General on the legality
    of the war in Iraq should be published in full.</p><p pid=\".1399.1/3\">I am pleased
    to be speaking to the motion, which stands in my name and in those of my hon.
    Friends. It is co-sponsored by Plaid Cymru&#8212;the party of Wales&#8212;and
    the Scottish National party.</p><p pid=\".1399.1/4\">The wording of the motion
    is tightly drawn, but for further clarity I should say that this debate is not
    about whether one was for or against the conflict in Iraq. As was explained to
    the House, my colleagues in Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party were against
    military action in Iraq before it started because we were not persuaded that the
    war was justified. We did not believe that either dossier displayed any credible
    threat, immediate or otherwise, from the tyrant Saddam, and that remains our opinion.
    There was no justification for the war then: ergo, there is a real question about
    the legality of the action that was taken. That is the issue on which we hope
    to concentrate this afternoon.</p><p pid=\".1399.1/5\">As the motion makes plain,
    we are calling for the Government to publish the advice or advices of the Attorney-General,
    because without such publication it will not be possible fully to inform the debate.
    Incidentally, both the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary have described
    the debate and the disagreement as \"legitimate.\" If we accept that the debate
    is legitimate, surely it is part of the function of Ministers of the Crown to
    inform it fully and apprise Parliament of all facts that are germane to the issue.
    That is beyond contradiction. In calling for the publication of the advice or
    advices, we call on the Government to inform the House.</p><p pid=\".1399.1/6\"\
    >Nothing in the \"Ministerial Code\" prevents the full publication of the advice
    or advices. In the foreword to the current code, the Prime Minister says:</p><p
    class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/7\">\"I believe we should be absolutely clear about
    how Ministers should account, and be held to account, by Parliament.\"</p><p pid=\"\
    .1399.1/8\">Paragraph 5 on page 1 states:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/9\"\
    >\"The code should be read against the background of the overarching duty on Ministers
    to comply with the law including international law and treaty obligations.\"</p><p
    pid=\".1399.1/10\">Ministers are expected to observe the seven principles of public
    life, which include openness. The code states:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/11\"\
    >\"Holders of public office should be as open as possible about all the decisions
    and actions they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict
    information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.\"</p><p pid=\"\
    .1399.1/12\">The code therefore provides that Ministers should be as open as possible
    with Parliament and the public, refusing information only when that is considered
    to be in the public interest.</p><p pid=\".1399.1/13\">When considering the disclosure
    by Ministers of Law Officers' opinions, it is helpful to consult \"The Law Officers
    of the Crown\" by J. Ll. J. Edwards. The chapter of the 1964 edition entitled
    \"Attorney-General's Fiat and Responsibility to Parliament\" states on page 259:</p><p
    class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/14\">\"When Parliament is faced with situations
    involving the disclosure of the contents of the Law Officer's opinions to departmental
    Ministers, it is surely impossible to be dogmatic and to assert either the principle
    of absolute confidentiality, or on the other hand, a rule requiring the government
    to reveal in full or in part the content of the opinions. There may be circumstances,
    as exemplified by the Belfast Riots and the Archer Shee cases, in which everything
    is to be gained by telling the House all the facts.\"</p><p pid=\".1399.1/15\"\
    >It continues on page 260 that</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/16\">\"the
    better constitutional convention is the flexible rule expressed in Erskine May\"\
    .</p><p pid=\".1399.1/17\">The rule states:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/18\"\
    >\"The opinions of the Law Officers of the Crown, being confidential, are not
    usually laid before Parliament or cited in debate . . . But if a Minister deems
    it expedient that such opinions should be made known for the information of the
    House, he is entitled to cite them in debate.'\"</p><p pid=\".1399.1/19\">Page
    261 of Edwards states:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/20\">\"Intransigence
    on the part of Ministers or Members of the Commons when issues of this nature
    arise for debate is not calculated to enhance the prestige of Parliament or the
    administration of justice. So far as the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General
    are concerned, in suitable cases sufficient reason should be given to convince
    the House of Commons that the Law Officer has considered all the relevant factors
    and has reached his decision with that impartiality of judgement which is the
    ultimate strength and protection of the constitutional independence of the Law
    Officers of the Crown.\"</p><p pid=\".1399.1/21\">There are several examples of
    the disclosure of Law Officers' advices. For example, Law Officers' advice on
    the compatibility of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 has been publicly available
    in the Public Record Office since 1998. Their advice on the legality of proposed
    merchant shipping legislation and its compatibility with European law, as disclosed
    to the courts in the Factortame litigation, is available in the House of Lords
    Record Office. In a written answer on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2004-01-12\"\
    >12 January</phrase>, Baroness Amos stated:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\".1399.1/22\"\
    >\"In 1993, Law Officers' advice relevant to the subject matter of the Arms to
    Iraq inquiry was disclosed to the Scott inquiry.\"&#8212;[<i>Official Report,
    House of Lords</i>, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2004-01-12\">12 January 2004</phrase>;
    Vol. 656, c. <i>WA</i> 64.]</p><p pid=\".1399.1/23\">Hon. Members may remember
    that the advice was published in its entirety as an annexe to the report.</p><p
    pid=\".1399.1/24\">The Government's amendment refers to a hard-and-fast convention.
    I do not know on what evidence they base that. There is no hard-and-fast, time-honoured
    convention.</p>"

    charities, political experts, young people and organisations representing them,

    shall be damned to ever-falling turnouts and rocketing disengagement, especially
    among the recently enfranchised and society, or even both. That is clearly damaging
    to democracy, and unsustainable for the legitimate and important work of political
    parties. Unless we buck up our ideas and respond to the problem, it will be very
    difficult to fix.</p><p pid=".1462.2/4">There is a range of general measures that
    we should support to boost younger people's interest in democracy. I believe that
    Members in all parts of the House support measures such as enhanced and attractive
    policies for younger people, improved use of the internet and information technology,
    and better outreach to schools and colleges by politicians and interest groups.</p><p
    pid=".1462.2/5">One recent and overwhelmingly positive development in my constituency
    has been the establishment of a parliamentary youth internship programme in conjunction
    with local high schools. A victim of our own success, we now have a considerable
    backlog of students seeking to gain a few days' or weeks' experience in the holidays
    of how an MP's office works, and a better understanding of the parliamentary process.
    I strongly recommend the programme to other Members.</p>

  question: It being six hours after the commencement of proceedings, Mr. Speaker
    put forthwith the Question, pursuant to Order [this day],
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid=".1715.4/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid=".1715.4/2" pwmotiontext="yes">This
    is an important moment for the future of higher education in this country. I believe
    that the decisions that the House has taken in considering this important Bill
    secure the future of our universities and enable them to make the economic and
    social contributions that our society needs. They prepare the country for the
    future in a way that, to be fair, I believe hon. Members on both sides of the
    House want to see. As the Bill goes to the other place, we are producing a measure
    for its consideration that guarantees more resources for universities, that will
    open and strengthen access to universities and that will ensure that people from
    the poorest communities in the country get a fair crack in our society.</p><p
    pid=".1715.4/3">Many people deserve thanks, and I should like to take a moment
    to thank colleagues for what they have done. First, I thank the Minister for Lifelong
    Learning, Further and Higher Education and our colleagues in the ministerial team,
    the Parliamentary Private Secretaries and in the Whips Office for what has been
    an outstanding performance. I know that no one will mind if I particularly thank
    my right hon. Friend for the tremendous leadership that he has shown throughout
    the consideration of the Bill.</p><p pid=".1715.4/4">Secondly, I thank my official
    team, the Bill team led by Lesley Longstone, and her colleagues who have given
    outstanding support, as I hope that colleagues on both sides of the House would
    agree, to all those hon. Members who have wanted to make points. Thirdly, I want
    to thank political colleagues on both sides of the House. There have been substantial
    and difficult debates, with real tension, as everyone has been aware, but throughout
    people of different opinions have been ready to engage in serious dialogue in
    a way that I appreciate and that shows the strength of the House as a place where
    political consideration can properly take place. It would be invidious to name
    individuals, but I repeat that a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House
    have been ready to engage in serious dialogue about the important issues that
    we have discussed. I emphasise that the way in which they have done so is important
    for the reputation of the House and Parliament and for the future of our universities.</p><p
    pid=".1715.4/5">Finally, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, the Clerks and, indeed, those
    in the wider university sector for their engagement in the debate on the Bill,
    which I have the honour to present on Third Reading this evening.</p>

    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid=".1524.0/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    am grateful for the co-operation and assistance of the Under-Secretary of State
    for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/872"
    name="Maria Eagle">the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle)</phrase>. She
    has tackled important pensions issues that have concerned many hon. Members and
    I thank her for her detailed deliberations on those matters.</p><p pid=".1524.0/3">This
    is a Bill with a simple rationale. It addresses the difficulties faced by a small,
    vulnerable minority who have been denied basic legal rights for too long, and
    seeks to provide transsexual people with legal recognition of an everyday reality:
    the gender to which they now belong. On meeting the criteria in the Bill, a person
    will become in law the gender in which he or she now lives. That means that he
    or she will be able to get a birth certificate that reflects the acquired gender,
    and be able to marry or claim a pension in that gender.</p><p pid=".1524.0/4">Of
    course, a Bill of this kind raises issues about the rights of others. We have
    had an important debate today about the right to freedom of religion, and I hope
    that we have demonstrated that we are alive to those concerns and are engaging
    with religious communities and their representatives. Just as the Bill provides
    legal recognition of the identity of transsexual people, it also respects the
    conscience of others.</p><p pid=".1524.0/5">Many hon. Members have made an invaluable
    contribution to scrutiny of the Bill. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/743"
    name="Tim Boswell">The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase> has been
    remarkably thorough, and in Committee he tabled a series of probing amendments
    that allowed us further to discuss some of the key aspects of the Bill. The Government
    amendment on placing the panels under the supervision of the Council on Tribunals&#8212;which
    was agreed to today&#8212;was a consequence of one of those probes.</p><p pid=".1524.0/6">The
    hon. Members for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) and for Teignbridge (Richard
    Younger-Ross) welcomed the Bill, and although there were areas in which they would
    have preferred the Government to legislate otherwise, I hope that they agree with
    the view expressed by members of the transsexual community that the Bill meets
    95 per cent. of the needs of transsexual people.</p><p pid=".1524.0/7">On the
    Labour Benches, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1004"
    name="Lynne Jones">the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase>
    merits particular credit. She has been a forceful advocate of the rights of transsexual
    people for many years in the House. She set up the parliamentary forum on transsexualism,
    and she has brought her expertise and experience to bear on our consideration
    of the Bill. She and the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon both caused
    us to reconsider the issue of foreign gender change and to table the amendment
    to clause 21 that was agreed to earlier today.</p><p pid=".1524.0/8">Perhaps most
    importantly of all, hon. Members have discussed these issues with compassion and
    understanding, and I know that that has been appreciated beyond the Chamber. Many
    in the small community of transsexual people feel that they are excluded no more,
    that the House does not regard their concerns as trivial, and that the Bill is
    creating a robust and credible process whereby they can gain legal recognition
    of the gender in which they now live.</p><p pid=".1524.0/9">The Bill is about
    equality, human rights, dignity and respect. We judge our civilised societies
    by how they treat their minority communities. I suspect that the House has never
    before had to consider equality and human rights legislation on behalf of such
    a small minority, and it is a credit to the House that this judgment has been
    made today and that the Bill should receive its Third Reading.</p>'

    Bill represents a historic step on what has been a long journey to respect and
    dignity for lesbians and gay men in Britain. It is a natural progression in our
    vision to build an inclusive society. As such, it builds on reforms that began
    back in 1967 with Leo Abse's private Member's Bill, backed by the then Home Secretary,
    Roy Jenkins. The Government's commitment to equality has been strong and unequivocal.
    We have equalised the age of consent, outlawed discrimination in the workplace
    on the ground of sexual orientation, secured protection from homophobic hate crimes
    and supported the abolition of section 28.</p><p pid=".174.2/3">In creating a
    new legal relationship for same-sex couples, this Bill is a sign of the Government's
    commitment to social justice and equality. It is also a recognition of the realities
    of modern Britain. Across this country today thousands of same-sex couples have
    made the decision to share their lives, their home, their finances and the care
    of their children or of older relatives. They may have loved and cared for each
    other for many years, yet their relationship is invisible in the eyes of the law.
    The Bill sends a clear message about the importance of stable and committed same-sex
    relationships.</p>

    efficiency should be increased. In debates on this issue in the other place, the
    Government were accused of weakening their position on that commitment, but I
    hope to be able to demonstrate the fallacy of that argument. I will also show

    the senseless murder of David Morley, a survivor of the bomb attack on the Admiral
    Duncan pub, and another recent attack in which a man was stabbed on his way home

    thank hon. Members on both sides of the House who have brought the legislation
    to this stage, and in doing so I should like to recognise that this is an issue
    that for many presents fundamental difficulties and conflicts of moral principle,
    but I am grateful to the House for the spirit of tolerance in which all stages
    of the Bill so far have been conducted.</p><p pid="a.126.0/3">It is important
    to recall the principles that underpin the legislation&#8212;that children and
    vulnerable adults should be protected, and that gambling in Britain should be
    kept crime-free, and conducted according to the principles of fair play. Everything
    in the Bill will be judged against those principles. If we secure the legislation,
    we shall have the toughest, most comprehensive regulatory framework in the world
    to protect the public interest and to prevent the exploitation of children.</p><p
    pid="a.126.0/4">This is legislation that has been shaped over the past five years.
    A major contribution has been made by the Joint Committee, to whose members I
    pay tribute, particularly to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/923"
    name="John Greenway">the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>. I hope
    that hon. Members on both sides of the House will recognise that the Government
    have listened to the concerns raised, as we undertook to do on Second Reading.</p><p
    pid="a.126.0/5">It is a curious thing in modern British politics that in one breath
    Ministers are accused of being arrogant, out of touch and refusing to listen,
    and in the next breath, when they have listened and responded positively, they
    are accused by the same people of a humiliating climbdown or a screeching U-turn.
    Ministers are damned if they do listen and damned if they do not, so they may
    as well listen&#8212;otherwise, what is the point of Parliament? We have listened
    to the concerns raised about the Bill, and it is a better Bill as a result, in
    relation to casinos, bingo, charity lotteries and the important issues raised
    by colleagues in connection with seaside arcades.</p>

    yesterday that were in order and tabled within the appropriate time for them to
    be considered for selection. I accept that when the Government drafted the programme
    motion and published it this morning, they were unable to take into account the
    amendments that I tabled.</p><p pid="a.1027.4/11">My amendment seeks to find half
    an hour in a hectic programme to discuss what I consider to be an important issue.
    I was not privileged to be a member of the Standing Committee. The Committee considered
    the transfer of the Royal Parks constabulary to the Metropolitan police, but it
    did not address the individual rights of members of staff who are to be transferred.
    If we in the House have any role, our prime role is to protect the rights of the
    individual, whether they be constituents or others.</p><p pid="a.1027.4/12">The
    Royal Parks police consists of 141 officers, of whom 42 are members of a trade
    union, the PCS. Those members of staff, who have served loyally in the royal parks
    and were commended in Committee for their work, will lose their right to be members
    of a trade union when they are transferred to the Metropolitan police. They will
    also lose the value of their pension&#8212;estimated at about a 30 per cent. loss.
    There was no debate about that in Committee, because I do not believe that many
    hon. Members understood the implications.</p><p pid="a.1027.4/13">I can find no
    opportunity for debate on Monday, except in the last section of the programme,
    when many other issues will be debated. As the relevant clause is clause 144,
    it is unlikely to be reached. We are breaching the fundamental human rights of
    the individuals in question. When we discussed GCHQ and the protection of the
    right to become a trade unionist, the Government were clearly committed to those
    human rights. The measure will also affect the future standard of living of those
    members of staff, and that warrants a debate. For that reason, I have suggested
    that we give a small amount of time&#8212;half an hour&#8212;one third of the
    way into the programme so that we can deal with the matter.</p><p pid="a.1027.4/14">If
    we cannot amend the programme motion in that way today, I urge the Minister to
    take the matter back to her colleagues. It has not been addressed, and I urge
    her to give sympathetic consideration to the amendments that I tabled and make
    a statement on Monday about how the Government propose to address this important
    matter.</p>

    of that.</p><p pid="a.1673.1/18">The Bill has been given proper scrutiny. Indeed,
    in preparation for it we had a six-month public consultation exercise, starting
    in 2002. There was an inquiry by the Home Affairs Select Committee, starting in
    2003. There was further consultation on a draft Bill in 2004. The Government responded
    to all those consultations in the way in which the Bill was presented to the House.</p><p
    pid="a.1673.1/19">On the last sitting of the Standing Committee, on the afternoon
    of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-27">27 January</phrase>, we dealt with amendments
    and agreed to 20 clauses and one schedule&#8212;clauses 26 to 45 and schedule
    2. That indicates how quickly progress could have been made in large parts of
    the Bill.</p><p pid="a.1673.1/20">After the first two sittings of the Committee,
    the Government proposed a timetable motion for the remaining consideration of
    the Bill in Committee. That was at the beginning of the fourth day on the morning
    of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-25">25 January</phrase>. The motion was
    agreed to only after we had spent an inordinate time debating a group of two amendments
    to clause 8&#8212;one hour and 10 minutes on the afternoon of <phrase class="date"
    code="2005-01-20">20 January</phrase> followed by a further one hour and 35 minutes
    on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-25">25 January</phrase>.
    Two and three quarter hours was spent on the same group of amendments.</p><p pid="a.1673.1/21">A

    rest my case only on the time. The Chairman of the Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase
    class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/720" name="Nigel Beard">the Member
    for Bexleyheath and Crayford (Mr.   Beard)</phrase>, had to intervene nine times
    to remind Opposition members of the Committee of the need to keep in order on
    the morning of the second of those two sittings alone. The debate was brought
    to a close when, unusually, the Chairman agreed to a motion that the Question
    be now put. I do not have extensive experience in the House, but I have served
    on a number of Standing Committees. I have never before known a Chairman of a
    Standing Committee to accept a motion that the Question be now put. It is clear
    to me that the Chairman, having intervened of his own volition on nine occasions,
    had no alternative but to do that.</p>

    that the public debate started under my predecessor in 2002 and that the draft

    of ID cards. It also gives legislative authority for expenditure on setting up
    the ID cards scheme and for charging fees.</p><p pid="b.1151.3/4">In brief, the
    Bill establishes the national identity register; provides powers to issue biometric
    ID cards either linked to existing designated documents or as stand-alone ID cards;
    ensures that checks can be made against databases to confirm an applicant's identity
    and guard against fraud; sets out what information will be held&#8212;including
    biometrics&#8212;and what safeguards will be put in place; enables public and
    private sector organisations to verify a person's identity, with their consent;
    includes enabling powers, so that, in future, access to specified public services
    could be linked to the production of a valid card; provides a power for it to
    become compulsory at a future date to register and to be issued with a card, which
    includes civil penalties against failure to register; creates a national identity
    scheme commissioner to have oversight of the whole scheme; and creates new criminal
    offences on the possession of false ID cards.</p><p pid="b.1151.3/5">There has
    been general support for ID cards, but many serious, practical concerns have been

    Brother society&#8212;it has been described in other ways. Secondly, I shall address
    issues of cost, which are a serious concern for many hon. Members on both sides
    of the House. Thirdly, I shall set out the benefits of the scheme for both individuals
    and society. Fourthly, I shall address the concerns about the project's size,
    technology and scale. Fifthly, I shall deal with safeguards and legal processes.

  tidied_motion: That this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Identity
    Cards Bill because the scheme proposed in the Bill will make no significant contribution
    to the reduction or eradication of terrorism, illegal immigration, or illegal
    employment; contains no proper safeguards to limit or prescribe the information

    may be levied by the Secretary of State; and the Bill provides for the costs of

    understand the Bill's implications, the more they realise that what is a superficially

    growing among the labour movement, the trade union movement and, as we have seen,
    Labour Members.</p><p pid="b.1197.0/4">The point of principle is not the introduction
    of an identity document that includes biometrics, which is inevitable, but the
    creation of a national registration scheme and national database. Notwithstanding

    Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>,
    I am not het up about the question of whether ID cards should be compulsory, because,
    as the Government have said, the card will be of limited use on its own.</p><p
    pid="b.1197.0/5">In the Government's view, the ability to check the card against
    the record on the register will make the system secure. Far from providing benefits,
    however, the establishment of a huge database with everyone's personal details
    conveniently concentrated in one place could be very dangerous. It would create
    an ID-theft bonanza for any terrorists or criminals who penetrate the security&#8212;let
    us make no bones about it, they will find ways to penetrate the security. Computer
    experts have told us that no such database can be 100 per cent. secure, and that
    point has been proved in America, where the Department of Motor Vehicles database
    has been attacked.</p>

    that the motion is intended to assist the House in using our available time this
    afternoon on Report to the very best possible effect? We have made good progress
    on the Bill thus far. There have been seven days and 11 sittings in Committee,
    starting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-05">5 July</phrase> and finishing
    on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July</phrase>. We had a timetable
    motion in Committee in order to ensure good progress, and as a result of the knives,
    only clauses 12 and 13 and parts of clause 5 failed to be discussed&#8212;some
    seven groups of amendments in all. We certainly debated far more than seven groups
    of amendments in Committee.</p><p pid="d.708.1/16">Although I should point out
    that there was plenty of time to raise issues, I am told that we spent, in total,
    some 26 hours and six minutes in all. We were even offered the possibility of
    a final sitting on the afternoon of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21
    July</phrase>, but in the event it was not needed or required by Opposition parties.
    We thus had more than sufficient time.</p><p pid="d.708.1/17">Because of the need
    to make the best use of available time, we propose to divide today's timetable
    with knives at 5.45 and 7.15 to ensure that all parts of the Bill are properly
    scrutinised.</p><p pid="d.708.1/18">I readily recognise that there are important
    and serious matters for us to discuss, but we need to parcel up the business in
    this way to allow for Third Reading at 9 pm as normal. If hon. Members want to
    debate the Bill, they should accept the motion and let us get on with that debate.
    The House will surely agree that it would be better for us to spend time this
    afternoon debating the Bill and the substantial matters before us rather than
    taking time to debate at length whether or not to timetable the debate. With that
    in mind, our motion will help order our debate sensibly.</p>

    That the Bill be recommitted to a Select Committee.</p><p class="" pid="d.717.2/2"
    pwmotiontext="yes">Members hold many serious reservations about the Bill, and
    even more reservations are held by people outside the House. That is not reason
    in itself to recommit to a Select Committee; indeed, there is opportunity under
    the normal Committee and Report process for us to consider the principled reasons,
    but the Bill, almost more than any other, depends on the practicalities. If it
    does not work, if it costs vastly more than the Government say it will cost and
    if conclusions can be drawn about the scope of the information stored on identity
    cards, the enabling Bill&#8212;on repeated occasions, the Minister has stressed
    that it is enabling legislation&#8212;has completely different connotations and
    the House ought seriously to consider them.</p><p pid="d.717.2/3">I accept that
    the Standing Committee process is, in many ways, a good means of examining the
    detail of a Bill&#8212;line by line&#8212;but it is difficult for a Standing Committee
    to perform the same role in respect of this enabling Bill. The process is thus
    imperfect and does not allow hon. Members to consider matters in depth.</p><p
    pid="d.717.2/4">The Committee that considered the Bill certainly did not have
    the opportunity to examine issues in detail, many of which the Government raised
    following the conclusion of the 11th sitting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21

    official colleagues who have worked so hard and have been ready on all occasions
    to discuss with all interests how we can improve the Bill and take it forward
    in a variety of ways. I thank the House authorities and the Clerks for the way
    in which the business has been conducted through a time-consuming process.</p><p
    pid="d.797.4/3">The Bill before the House is based closely on that approved by
    the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February 2005</phrase>,
    so this is the second time that I have come to the House to propose that an Identity
    Cards Bill should receive its Third Reading. The Bill before us has had more scrutiny
    than most legislation. We had a six-month public consultation exercise starting
    in 2002, an inquiry by the Home Affairs Select Committee starting in 2003 and
    further consultation on the draft Bill in 2004. The first Bill was introduced
    in November 2004 and ran out of time because of the general election, and we now
    have reached the point for the current Bill to be approved by the House.</p><p
    pid="d.797.4/4">I believe that the time has come when we need the benefits and
    safeguards that an identity cards scheme will provide both to individuals, who
    will be able to prove their identity securely and reliably, and in the wider public
    interest. The identity card is an essential step in the process of providing a
    clear legislative framework for introducing identity cards. I know that the system
    has been controversial; the issue itself is controversial. But I believe that
    we all need to understand that we already live in a society in which enormous
    banks of information are held about all of us, whether by financial institutions,
    employers, passport and driving licence authorities, health and education authorities
    or criminal justice agencies. Moreover, we all now face many occasions on which
    we need to prove our identity, whether to open a bank account, to take out a mortgage,
    to claim a benefit, to pass through a border control, to get a Criminal Records
    Bureau clearance or many other basic transactions of our day-to-day lives. I believe
    that an up-to-date identity cards system will make all those transactions easier
    for the individual and will also be beneficial for the state. It will provide
    an effective mechanism to tackle crime, to reduce identity fraud, and to improve
    legitimate access to services. I believe that it will not remove civil liberties
    but will give an individual greater control over his identity.</p><p pid="d.797.4/5">Some
    have alleged that the Bill will create a Big Brother state. I do not believe that.
    I believe that it will help to control that state. It is an ambitious programme,
    I acknowledge, but one that we are setting on the path to achieve.</p>

    this year, and I set out a list of measures to the Opposition spokespeople on
    <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2005-07-15\">15 July</phrase>. I am grateful to
    them both for the constructive response that they were able to give. I also made
    it clear that we were consulting the police and intelligence agencies in the light
    of the terrorist attacks and would consider whether additional measures were required.
    On that basis, I sent out a draft Bill to the Opposition and to Committee Chairs
    on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2005-09-15\">15 September</phrase>.</p><p pid=\"\
    b.322.2/5\">In the light of the helpful comments that we received from a variety
    of sources, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2005-10-06\">6 October</phrase> I
    set out some revised proposals in respect of the offence of glorification. On
    the same day, my right hon. Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary published
    a paper setting out anti-terrorism laws in other countries, which I hope will
    help to inform today's debate. In the same spirit, through the usual channels
    we agreed a substantial amount of time to debate the Bill in Committee and on
    Report on the Floor of the House.</p><p pid=\"b.322.2/6\">That is how we reached
    the stage that we are at today. In addressing the central issue that we face,
    I must start from the fundamental premise that there is a serious terrorist threat
    that has to be addressed. From New York, Nairobi, Sharm el-Sheik, Istanbul, two
    offences in Bali&#8212;one recently&#8212;Madrid, and our own events in London
    this July, we know of the existence of that terrorist threat. As we legislate
    to address it, we must do so on the basis, first, of clarifying the values and
    society that we are seeking to defend, and, secondly, of identifying the threat
    with which we have to deal.</p><p pid=\"b.322.2/7\">Of all the societies throughout
    the world, perhaps that of the United Kingdom is the society that laid the basis
    for the values that we here seek to defend: valuing and building free speech and
    freedom of expression, including a free media; believing in a society that respects
    all faiths, races and beliefs; believing in a society founded on the rule of law;
    wanting every citizen to have a democratic stake in our society; valuing the free
    economy, which has built prosperity, including high-quality public services on
    which we all depend; and valuing the fact that women can play a full role in our
    society. We all know that our society, based on those values, will continue to
    evolve and develop. We also know that we can all point to aspects of our society
    that fall short of those aspirations. However, people on all sides of politics
    have struggled over the centuries to achieve the values that we celebrate today.</p><p
    pid=\"b.322.2/8\">The society that we have built, with the values that it embodies,
    is not slight nor passing but deeply rooted and profound. I emphasise that those
    values are embraced by the overwhelming majority of our citizens, from whatever
    faith group or minority ethnic group they come. Indeed, most of those who migrated
    to our country did so precisely because they wanted to embrace the values that
    I just set out. Our society is characterised by common values but diverse backgrounds,
    faiths and lifestyles. It has been a stunningly successful model of integration,
    despite regular challenges.</p><p pid=\"b.322.2/9\">If one compares the United
    Kingdom of the 1950s, before significant migration took place, with the United
    Kingdom of today, one sees that in many key parts of life and endeavour&#8212;our
    businesses, our design, our literature, our food; there are too many to name&#8212;the
    vibrancy of diversity has powered creativity and economic success. I emphasise
    again, however, that that has always happened within the framework of our common
    democratic values.</p>"

    recall that the programme motion passed after Second Reading allocated us six
    hours in total for Report. However, any votes in the middle of that would have

    that part of our proceedings. Once that concludes, any votes that are necessary
    will take place, and they will not cut into the House's remaining time. Once all
    the votes have taken place, we will then have a further three hours on the remaining
    groups of amendments, followed by whatever Divisions are required. I hope that
    the whole House will recognise the benefits of that.</p>

    were considered in a spirit of reasonable discourse and, on the odd day, with
    some intellectual rigour. Our sittings were extremely useful and productive, as
    is right and proper given that the Bill deals with a range of extremely serious
    matters in the context of an important political debate. That description applied
    even before the Government introduced&#8212;with agreement&#8212;the counter-terrorism
    clauses after the Bill had been published. That was a most unusual way of proceeding,
    but the House in the main will understand why things happened that way. There
    was a significant degree of cross-party agreement on the process, if not on the
    substance of those clauses.</p>

    reduce the voting age.</p><p pid="c.138.1/4">Like all of us, I have visited many
    schools and colleges during, and in between, elections. I have always been impressed
    by the penetrating and incisive questions and by the open way in which ideas are
    debated. Contrast that with a typical wet evening during an election when one
    meets someone on the doorstep who has no time, is not interested, would rather
    be watching the television, or offers an opinion that they say is fact but actually
    matches what they read in the newspapers that morning. Reducing the voting age
    to 16 is an idea whose time has come. It is a shame that the Government failed
    to grasp that opportunity for change in the Electoral Administration Bill.</p><p
    pid="c.138.1/5">The parliamentary franchise was extended six times between 1832
    and 1969. Each extension was met with opposition and scepticism. Indeed, after
    the Second Reform Act 1867, the Prime Minister of the day, Lord Derby, described
    his own measure as a "leap in the dark". Robert Lowe, who was to become Gladstone's
    first Chancellor of the Exchequer, remarked that the Government would have to
    "educate our masters".</p><p pid="c.138.1/6">In the 21st century, our eyes can
    be open and we can see that we have the best ever educated, informed and politically
    interested cohort of 16 and 17-year-olds. In recent times, young people's interest
    has been awakened in politics. Perhaps one of the few silver linings of the Iraq
    war is that young people take an interest in the Chamber's deliberations and the
    fundamental decisions that we can make in this place.</p><p pid="c.138.1/7">All
    hon. Members will have been lobbied here and in our constituencies by young constituents
    about issues such as third-world poverty and climate change. Young people will
    shortly take an interest in controversial education measures, which will be determined
    here, just as they recently took an interest in decisions that affected their
    access to higher education.</p><p pid="c.138.1/8">Like the rest of us, young people
    can pick and hoover up information 24 hours a day through television and the internet.
    In schools, citizenship is compulsory at key stages 3 and 4 for all 11 to 16-year-olds
    in England, stimulating community involvement and political literacy. In 1969,
    when Parliament previously decided to extend the franchise, the school-leaving
    age was 15 and most people left school at 15. Few went on to further education
    and even fewer to higher education. In 2005, the educational world is totally
    different. I am sure that today's teenagers have the same social interests as
    their counterparts in the 1960s, but this decade's 16-year-olds are better informed
    and of a similar maturity to 18-year-olds of nearly 40 years ago. It is now time
    for them to use their knowledge and maturity and for us to extend the vote to
    them.</p><p pid="c.138.1/9">The Prime Minister often talks about rights, responsibilities
    and respect. Young people already have various rights and responsibilities when
    they are under 18. At 16, they can leave school, go to work and join the Army.
    In both latter circumstances, they will pay taxes. They can marry or&#8212;shortly&#8212;enter
    into a civil partnership. All of us would agree that entering into a marriage
    is a long-term commitment and a fundamental decision that is far more important
    to someone's life and future than choosing between candidates in an election.</p><p
    pid="c.138.1/10">At 17, one can learn to drive. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit &#214;pik">the Member for Montgomeryshire
    (Lembit &#214;pik)</phrase> could learn to pilot a plane but he was not trusted
    with the vote. We give young people many rights and responsibilities but, as politicians,
    we do not always give them the respect of listening to their opinions.</p><p pid="c.138.1/11">Many
    of us have expressed worries about democracy in our country and especially about
    turnout at elections. I believe that voting at 16 could boost turnout in the long
    run. The Social Market Foundation conducted some interesting research on the topic.
    It undertook a study of 17 and 18-year-olds who either just missed out or just
    qualified to vote in the April 1992 general election. Those who missed out in
    1992 had to wait until they were 22 or 23 before they could vote in the 1997 general
    election. In 2001, that group of people was studied and it was found that 49 per
    cent. of 17-year-olds who had just missed out in 1992 voted in 2001 but that 65
    per cent. of the 18-year-olds who qualified for the vote in 1992 voted in the
    general election nine years later. That is a 16 per cent. gain in turnout through
    an exercise of the franchise at the earliest opportunity.</p><p pid="c.138.1/12">Bristol's
    twin city, Hanover, has recently extended the vote to 16-year-olds and it was
    found that they are twice as likely to turn out to vote in elections as people
    in their late 20s.</p><p pid="c.138.1/13">Let me trespass briefly on the territory
    of the next debate. Cigarette manufacturers believe that a person whom they can
    get to take up smoking by the age of 16 is likely to be addicted for many years
    but that, of those who resist the temptation into their 20s, few take up smoking.
    Votes for 16-year-olds will be a healthier habit for people to take up.</p><p
    pid="c.138.1/14">What are the arguments against extending the franchise to 16
    and 17-year-olds? Some people argue that there is pressure from families, campaign
    groups and political parties, especially in marginal seats in elections; that
    the voting age in all but a handful of democracies throughout the planet is the
    same as that in the United Kingdom. It is argued that young people are not mature
    enough, even with education. It is claimed that knowledge may be one thing but
    mature judgment is another and that young people do not see the broader picture.
    All of those opinions will have been offered in the past few years while the debate
    has been on the agenda, and I am sure that they will be offered in time to come.
    I obtained all of them through a perusal of <i>Hansard</i> from November 1968,
    when the House decided to reduce the voting age from 21 to 18. Similar arguments
    were advanced in the 19th and 20th centuries when it was said that middle-class
    paternalism could protect the interests of the working classes, or husbands could
    make decisions on behalf of their wives, or parents on behalf of their children.
    Those were Aunts Sallies then and I think that they deserve to be knocked down
    now.</p><p pid="c.138.1/15">Voting at the age of 16 is supported by Members of
    all parties in the House. Early-day motion 801, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1647" name="Diana Johnson">the hon. Member for Kingston
    upon Hull, North (Ms   Johnson)</phrase>, now has the support of 90 signatures.
    Outside Parliament, the campaign is supported by children's charities and political
    campaigners from Barnardo's and the Children's Society to the National Union of
    Students and the YMCA.</p><p pid="c.138.1/16">Extending the franchise to 16-year-olds
    will not be a leap in the dark. Rather than having to educate our new electoral
    masters, we would find them the most responsive and responsible constituents.
    I believe that young people are informed, engaged and ready to vote. I hope that
    by introducing the Bill, I have contributed to a debate that will eventually lead
    to a franchise that is fit for the 21st century.</p>

  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="b.1048.0/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="b.1048.0/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    suppose that this would be a good time to thank all those who have been involved
    in the passage of the Bill, so I start by thanking the members of the Committee
    and all hon. Members who contributed on Report and, indeed, on Second Reading
    back in the summer. I especially thank the hon. Members for East Devon (Mr. Swire)
    and for Bath (Mr. Foster), who led for the Opposition in Committee and, in the
    latter case, on Report. Both hon. Members were nothing but dogged in their determination
    to test me on certain points. Hawkeye, as the hon. Member for Bath is now called,
    must undertake midnight reading of explanatory memorandums to ensure that everything
    is right with that as well. Of course, the doggedness of the hon. Member for East
    Devon actually paid off, and I would seriously like to congratulate him on his
    promotion to shadow Secretary of State. As I said earlier, I welcome <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities
    of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> to his post and have no doubt that
    we will clash over the Dispatch Box in the future.</p><p pid="b.1048.0/3">The
    National Lottery Bill has been debated for a long time, as the hon. Member for
    Bath said. When we look at legislation in great detail, it is easy to lose sight&#8212;as
    we sometimes do in Committee&#8212;of the overarching principles. The Bill will
    allow money to go to the good causes that are funded by the lottery. The formal
    creation of the Big Lottery Fund out of the merger of the Community Fund and the
    New Opportunities Fund, and the dissolution of the Millennium Commission, will
    yield a predicted &#163;6 million to &#163;7 million a year more. That money will
    be available to be spent across a range of good causes. It is good to be able
    to say to our constituents that more money will be available. We all know of many
    examples in our constituencies whereby lottery funding has made a difference to
    the lives of individuals and, on many occasions, to communities as a well. Once
    the Bill is passed, we can look forward to our constituencies receiving even more
    money from lottery funding and to the lottery as a whole becoming more open and
    responsive to those who play it.</p><p pid="b.1048.0/4">By enabling the public
    to have a say on lottery awards and the awards made in their communities, we will
    build on their confidence in the lottery. I can only reiterate that people vote
    with their feet&#8212;or their pockets&#8212;and if that can be taken as a sign,
    then the lottery is in good health. I said in Committee that the lottery came
    on to the statute book under a Conservative Administration. We have modernised
    it, and it is something of which we can all be proud. The lottery is now an institution.
    It is well respected, which is why people continue to play it. All the indications
    that we got from the consultation are that it is well respected and is doing a
    good job.</p><p pid="b.1048.0/5">There have even been lottery funds for the constituency
    of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" name="Charles
    Walker">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)</phrase>. The heroes return
    programme allows people who saw active service during world war two to fund commemorative
    visits. Of his constituents, it enabled six veterans, one widow, three spouses
    and seven carers to travel to France. That is what the lottery is all about. It
    can make all the difference to such brave people. Although the programme received
    a small amount, it probably changed, or at least enriched, their lives in a way
    that nothing else could.</p><p pid="b.1048.0/6">The Bill exemplifies what we always
    say: that the lottery has been, and will continue to be, independent of the Government.
    It also paves the way for a streamlined and easier application process for lottery
    grants with the one-entrance approach. Stephen Dunmore and the staff at the Big
    Lottery Fund are working hard to ensure that once an application is made, it gets
    to the right department in an efficient way.</p><p pid="b.1048.0/7">Under the
    Bill, the Government will take a lighter touch at the highest level on directing
    the way in which lottery money is spent. In addition, through the Bill, we will
    underline our commitment to ensuring that lottery money gets out of the door and
    into communities where it can do good as fast as possible.</p>'

    a positive and constructive attitude to the elements of a Bill that not only protects
    public health inside and outside hospital but will further improve the performance
    and efficiency of the national health service.</p><p pid="b.1375.3/3">Of course,
    the main focus of our debate and of public attention has been on the Bill's smoking
    provisions. This evening, the House voted absolutely decisively to introduce a
    complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces, including
    all licensed premises and private members' clubs. We have therefore not only delivered
    on the manifesto promise to ban smoking in virtually all public places and workplaces
    on which we were elected 10 months ago but have gone additional steps further.
    That reflects the excellent debate that took place on the smoking provisions in
    which I and my hon. Friends, who genuinely believed, and always have, that the
    arguments about private members' clubs were finely balanced, have none the less
    voted for a complete ban, particularly in the interests of ensuring a level playing
    field between different businesses such as small pubs and members' clubs. I recognise
    that there will be some disappointment among at least some members of private
    clubs at the outcome of the vote, but I nevertheless believe that it was the right
    one.</p><p pid="b.1375.3/4">The comprehensive ban for which the House has decisively
    voted will mean, over time, that some 600,000 people, beyond those who would have
    otherwise given up smoking, will be led to abandon it. The result of that and
    the protection that we are giving to people from second-hand smoking will be thousands
    of people's lives being saved and thousands of families being spared the grief
    of losing a loved one prematurely. That is why I think today's vote and the Bill
    will be seen as historic legislation on public health equivalent to, for instance,
    the legislation on seat belts of some decades ago.</p><p pid="b.1375.3/5">I am
    also delighted that, although it was not debated this afternoon, we have taken
    power to raise the age for the purchase of tobacco from 16 to 18 following the
    consultation in which we engaged. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley,
    East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase>, who has campaigned vigorously and effectively
    on that issue.</p><p pid="b.1375.3/6">Other vital provisions include the statutory
    code of practice on MRSA and associated health care infections. It will be very
    widely welcomed not only by the public, who quite rightly expect every hospital
    to get down their MRSA and other infection rates, but by staff in both the NHS
    and the independent sector.</p><p pid="b.1375.3/7">The Bill will also provide
    for much stronger management of controlled drugs in response to some of the shortcomings
    identified in the Shipman inquiry and will improve safeguards against the very
    small minority of people who would divert those drugs for personal abuse, financial
    gain or even, regrettably, for criminal purposes. It will also help us to continue
    improving and modernising NHS pharmacy services, ensuring, as my right hon. Friend
    the Minister of State said, that we can continue expanding the services offered
    by our pharmacists and make them much more convenient to patients.</p><p pid="b.1375.3/8">I
    was pleased to read the discussion in Committee during which the provision of
    ophthalmic services in England was praised. Although there was concern that the
    Bill would tamper with a service that is already excellent, I hope that hon. Members
    on both sides are reassured that by removing the restrictions on with whom a primary
    trust may contract to provide ophthalmic services the Bill will help to increase
    patient choice and thus continue to improve services. The new framework for ophthalmic
    services will ensure that we will be able to provide enhanced services in the
    community of the kind that are often available at present only in hospitals. That
    will be in line with the direction that we have just spelled out in the White
    Paper.</p>

    That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p><p class="" pid="c.1462.3/2" pwmotiontext="yes">Today,
    I set out before the House a Bill whose very heart and purpose is to give every
    child&#8212;no matter who they are or where they come from&#8212;the opportunity
    to fulfil their potential. I know that hon. Members on both sides of the House
    will want to make interventions as we go along. I have spent many&#8212;mainly
    happy&#8212;hours debating these issues with my hon. Friends and other hon. Members
    over the past few months, and I will be generous. But with the permission of the
    House, I will make some introductory remarks before I outline the main provisions
    in the Bill, after which point I will be happy to take many interventions.</p><p
    pid="c.1462.3/3">Last month, the parliamentary Labour party celebrated its 100-year
    anniversary. Every party has played a part in progress towards where we are now,
    but it is Labour Governments who have delivered the key reforms, backed by the
    investment that was so badly needed. We brought in comprehensive education, it
    was a Labour Prime Minister, Jim Callaghan, who 25 years ago led the debate on
    the national curriculum, and this Labour Government introduced free nursery places
    for all three and four-year-olds.</p><p pid="c.1462.3/4">Almost nine years into
    this Labour Government, spending on school buildings has increased sevenfold,
    there are 30,000 more teachers and more than 100,000 more support staff in our
    schools. Thanks to our sustained investment and reform, our children have been
    doing better, but we must do more. Yes, we have record results at ages 11 and
    14 and at GCSE, but still 45 per cent. of children do not get five good GCSEs.
    Yes, schools in deprived areas have improved even more quickly than the rest,
    but still seven out of 10 pupils on free school meals do not get five good GCSEs.
    Yes, we have record numbers of our young people staying on to study at A-level,
    but we still have one of the worst staying-on rates at age 16 of any country in
    the industrialised world. If Britain is going to go forward in the new global
    economy, I say to this House that that is simply not good enough. We must do better.</p><p
    pid="c.1462.3/5">That is what this Bill is about. For the first time, it puts
    a duty on local authorities to fulfil the educational potential not just of the
    bright or easy-to-teach child, but of every child. In addition, for the first
    time in the history of this country, this Bill introduces a right to a high-quality
    vocational education for every young person from the age of 14, reversing the
    historic weakness in vocational provision.</p><p pid="c.1462.3/6">If we want every
    school to be a good school, and that is our aim, we must act to make it happen,
    not just hope that it will. This Bill, through its proposals on trust schools,
    increased local authority intervention powers and stronger pressure to improve,
    does just that.</p><p pid="c.1462.3/7">I turn now to the proposals in the Bill
    on trusts, one of the matters raised with me most frequently over the past few
    months. Every hon. Member knows that schools work best when they have an effective
    head teacher who gives strong and inspiring leadership. This Bill will build on
    what we know works. It will give heads the powers that they need to forge new
    partnerships and drive up standards in their schools. Therefore, trust school
    status will allow head teachers to work closely with other schools, with colleges
    and with external partners such as universities, charities and business foundations,
    bringing new energy and commitment to the education of pupils at the school.</p><p
    pid="c.1462.3/8">Some people, including some Opposition Members, have argued that
    all schools should be compelled to become trust schools. However, I can tell the
    House that I will never force any school to become a trust school.</p>

    13 March</phrase>, when the House rejected them for the second time. However,

    be issued with an identity card.</p><p pid="b.1641.2/3">Yesterday, in the other
    place, the mover of the main Lords amendment, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, rebuked
    me in his summation in the following terms:</p><p class="indent" pid="b.1641.2/4">"The
    other thing worth saying is that last Monday, the Home Secretary . . . in levelling
    his defence against our proposal to make the scheme voluntary, did not in any
    sense call upon the constitutional justification of the Commons' position that
    has been the mainstay of the noble Baroness's closing speech"</p><p pid="b.1641.2/5">&#8212;he
    was referring to Baroness Scotland of Asthal&#8212;</p><p class="indent" pid="b.1641.2/6">"and
    has been the subject of speeches from various noble Lords. Mr Clarke attempted
    to justify the Government's case according to the issues that he raised in the
    other place&#8212;none of them were constitutional issues; they related to the
    merits and demerits of this Bill.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2006-03-15.1248"><i>Official
    Report, House of Lords,</i> 15 March 2006; Vol. 679, c. 1248&#8211;49</phrase>.]</p><p
    pid="b.1641.2/7">I intend to remedy that defect in my presentation today. Let
    me start with what was said by Lord Strathclyde, the leader of the main Opposition
    party in the Lords. He spoke very wisely, as befits a graduate of the University
    of East Anglia. He said:</p><p class="indent" pid="b.1641.2/8">"This House should
    always proceed with caution when it is trying to defeat the Government, even when
    it is asking the House of Commons to think again on a Bill it has passed. Generally
    speaking, we do that. I think we always do that. What is so unusual about this
    aspect is that the Government have already been defeated on two occasions, and
    therefore this is the third occasion on which we are dealing with this matter.</p><p
    class="indent" pid="b.1641.2/9">In this context, perhaps I may make three points.
    First, I think the House should proceed with caution and should deal with matters
    as controversial as this only when they are very few in number. This is the first
    time in this Session that we have come to an issue of this kind. Secondly, we
    should proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for
    what this House is doing. Thirdly, we should not proceed if there are issues to
    do with the Salisbury convention. My noble Friend and the Government may disagree
    about the use of the Salisbury convention; I am entirely satisfied that there
    are no Salisbury convention implications if the House were to return this small
    point back to another place."</p><p pid="b.1641.2/10">I shall deal with each of
    those three points. The first was that the House of Lords should proceed with
    caution. I think that Lord Strathclyde was quite right about that, and he should
    take his own advice. The fact is that the amendment is not a small point. It constitutes
    a major and deliberate effort by the Opposition parties to sabotage the whole
    of a Bill that has been agreed by this House, and that was set out to the public
    during the general election campaign. I hope that the Lords will indeed proceed
    with caution, and will not adopt a strategy that is designed to undermine the
    entire Bill.</p><p pid="b.1641.2/11">Secondly, Lord Strathclyde said that the
    other place</p><p class="indent" pid="b.1641.2/12">"should proceed only on an
    issue where there is a good deal of public support for what this House is doing."</p><p
    pid="b.1641.2/13">I remind the House&#8212;and perhaps, via this House, the other
    place&#8212;of the facts about public support. There is not such support for what
    the House of Lords is doing. Even the result of the latest opinion poll sponsored
    by the NO2ID campaign shows that 52 per cent. of the public are in favour, while
    Home Office research shows that 70 per cent. are in favour.</p><p pid="b.1641.2/14">Lord
    Strathclyde said that the other place</p><p class="indent" pid="b.1641.2/15">"should
    proceed only on an issue where there is a good deal of public support for what
    this House is doing."</p><p pid="b.1641.2/16">According to the NO2ID campaign,
    52 per cent. of people are in favour of the identity cards and against what the
    other place is doing; and, as I have said, Home Office research shows that 70
    per cent. are in favour.</p><p pid="b.1641.2/17">The Conservative election manifesto
    was entirely silent on the matter, although the then leader of the party was a
    known supporter of identity cards. However, the findings of an opinion poll published
    by ICM before the election, in December 2004, show that some 80 per cent. of the
    public were then in favour of the introduction of identity cards, with 88 per
    cent. of Conservative supporters, 81 per cent. of Labour supporters and 72 per
    cent. of Liberal Democrat supporters in favour. So the answer to Lord Strathclyde's
    second point&#8212;that the Lords should block the will of this elected Chamber
    only if there is clear public support&#8212;is that there is not.</p>

    concerns have been raised during the passage of this Bill, and I hope that Members
    on both sides will agree that the Government have listened very carefully and
    responded where possible to make this a better Bill. The House has conducted a
    mature and healthy debate on a matter of supreme importance to all of our constituents.</p><p
    pid="c.1588.0/3">Education remains this Government's priority. Since 1997, we
    have almost doubled education spending, so that today there is an unprecedented
    rebuilding and refurbishment programme, with more teachers and support staff who
    are better trained and using new books and computers in our classrooms. We have
    also made huge progress in tackling embedded problems with literacy, numeracy
    and failing schools. All this is reflected in the fact that schools today are
    achieving the best ever results at every key stage.</p><p pid="c.1588.0/4">However,
    serious problems remain. High achievement is unevenly spread, and the scales of
    educational opportunity are still tipped far too heavily against disadvantaged
    children. The Bill focuses on unleashing the potential of each and every child,
    and with nine years' successful experience in raising educational attainment,
    we can build on what we know works well.</p><p pid="c.1588.0/5">The Bill will
    help more schools to follow the path to high achievement. By enabling schools
    to become self-governing and to form links with a charitable trust, the Bill will
    give greater independence, but within a structure of increased interdependence,
    so that all those with an interest in successful schooling can make a full contribution
    to their local school. The opportunities are great for further and higher education
    establishments to entice more children to climb the ladder of attainment, for
    voluntary groups to bring in new ideas and fresh thinking, for business trusts
    to help focus on future careers and take forward the 14-to-19 agenda, and for
    schools to share best practice.</p><p pid="c.1588.0/6">The trust model also ensures
    that those relationships are permanent and lasting, rather than transient and
    dependent on a few visionaries whose departure heralds the collapse of the project.
    Trusts combine the best of all the existing models, and there has been broad consensus
    about their potential in principle. However, concerns have revolved around how
    they might operate in practice.</p>

    and misconceptions, which are unfortunately too prominent in our public debate,

    was laid before this House on 1st February, be approved.</p><p pid="c.434.1/3">The
    Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 received Royal Assent in March 2005. The Act
    provides for control orders to address the risk posed to public safety by individuals
    believed to be involved in terrorism who can neither be prosecuted nor deported.</p><p
    pid="c.434.1/4">The purpose of the order before us is simple. Today's renewal
    debate is taking place in accordance with section 13 of the 2005 Act. The powers
    contained in the Act will automatically lapse after one year unless renewed by
    order subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses. They were renewed last
    year but without this new order will lapse at the end of <phrase class="date"
    code="2007-03-10">10 March 2007</phrase>. I believe that a date is already in
    place for a similar debate in the other place.</p><p pid="c.434.1/5">The effect
    of the order will be to continue the power in force until the end of <phrase class="date"
    code="2008-03-10">10 March 2008</phrase>. That is what the order does and I will
    now expand on the specific needs for the power.</p><p pid="c.434.1/6">There is
    a serious and sustained threat from international terrorism to the UK and UK interests
    overseas. The current threat level is assessed as severe and an attack is judged
    to be highly likely. Moreover, since the tragic events of July 2005, the police
    and security services have had considerable success in disrupting alleged terrorist
    plots. Let me be clear that prosecution remains our preferred option for tackling
    individuals involved in terrorism. Indeed, that is why the Government strengthened
    the ability to prosecute for involvement in terrorism-related activity in the
    Terrorism Act 2006. That is demonstrated by the fact that, in 2006, 85 individuals
    were charged after being arrested under the 2006 Act or under other legislation
    where the investigation was conducted as a terrorist investigation.</p><p pid="c.434.1/7">Similarly,
    we seek to deport foreign nationals involved in terrorism, but that will sometimes
    not be possible, even with a memorandum of understanding and other agreements
    that are in place with a number of countries to enable us to return individuals
    safely to their country of origins. Consequently, there will remain a comparatively
    small number of individuals for whom neither prosecution nor deportation is viable.</p>

  question: ' Question put, pursuant to Standing Order No. 23 (Motions for leave to
    bring in Bills and nomination of Select Committees at commencement of public business):—'
  tidied_motion: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require practitioners providing
    contraception or abortion services to a child under the age of 16 to inform his
    or her parent or guardian; and for connected purposes.
  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\"c.290.1/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg
    to move,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c.290.1/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That leave
    be given to bring in a Bill to require practitioners providing contraception or
    abortion services to a child under the age of 16 to inform his or her parent or
    guardian; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/3\">The rates of unplanned
    pregnancy, abortion and sexually transmitted infections among under-age children
    in this country are shamefully high. They are higher than those in most other
    countries in the developed world, and certainly higher than those in any of our
    western European neighbours. There is an obvious reason for that: all the indications
    are that many children are becoming sexually active well before they are emotionally
    or physically mature. In children under the age of 15, the estimated figure is
    more than 40 per cent.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/4\">The Government have expressed concern
    about the situation, but their policy direction to try to tackle the problems
    has been misguided. Sex education in schools focuses heavily on the assumption
    that under-age children will be sexually active come what may and on providing
    all the contraception information that they need to avoid pregnancy and infection.
    However, statistics show that that approach is not working. It has done little
    to deter pupils from engaging in precocious sexual behaviour. Indeed, the plethora
    of information on contraception has given encouragement to children through false
    assurances that there will be no unwanted outcome. That is hardly surprising,
    as immature young people cannot be expected to make wise adult decisions. Interestingly,
    most schoolgirls who become pregnant or contract a sexually transmitted infection
    claim to have used contraception.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/5\">The aim of the Government's
    teenage pregnancy strategy, launched in 1999, was to halve teenage pregnancies
    in 10 years. That was a laudable aim, but by 2005 the rate had dropped by only
    five per 1,000&#8212;from the 1998 figure of 46.6 to 41.1 per 1,000. The figure
    for teenage pregnancies in 2005 reached 7,464 and some new mothers were as young
    as 13. Even the provision of the morning-after pill free of charge and without
    parental knowledge has had virtually no effect on numbers. Indeed, it could have
    been said to have encouraged some girls to increase their risky behaviour. On
    a visit to one of my local health centres recently I learned that far from using
    the morning-after pill as an emergency treatment, the same young girls are presenting
    regularly. Such small progress offers no hope of the strategy achieving its goal
    by 2009. It is time to try a different approach.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/6\">Young
    people are already surrounded by constant barrages of sexual images on television,
    in films, DVDs and magazines, and on advertisement hoardings&#8212;in fact, almost
    everywhere they turn. Clothing designed for pre-teenage girls often makes them
    look like provocative young adults. Sex and relationship education in schools
    should be used as an opportunity to redress the balance. Girls in particular need
    real-life warnings about the risks that they are taking with their emotional and
    physical health, and their future career and employment prospects. If the father
    of the child is an under-age boy, there will be no wedding and he will not be
    in a position to provide a home or financial support. The parents of the girl
    have to step forward, as from this point on full responsibility must be assumed
    by the girl and she will need their support as never before. How much better it
    would be if the parents had had the opportunity to divert their daughter from
    that course of action by being involved at a much earlier stage.</p><p pid=\"\
    c.290.1/7\">Under-age girls run a very real risk of contracting a sexually transmitted
    infection, which may have a long-term impact on their reproductive lives. Almost
    90 per cent. of the children aged between 13 and 15 seeking treatment for sexually
    transmitted infections are girls. In north-east London, the incidence of chlamydia
    is one of the highest in the country. That sexually transmitted infection is different
    in that it is symptom-free, so girls are usually unaware that they have it until
    much later in life when they are married and have fertility problems that mean
    they are unable to have a planned family. That often leads to years of distressing
    fertility treatment with very unpredictable results. One of the main contributory
    reasons to that condition is too early sexual activity.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/8\"\
    >Pregnancy often comes unexpected and unplanned and the girl, who is still a child
    herself and still at school, finds that her life has suddenly taken a different
    course. A child who has been engaging in adult behaviour suddenly faces serious,
    life-changing decisions when she does not have the adult skills or resources to
    cope. Many parents are unaware that their child is sexually active and the news
    that she is expecting a child of her own comes as a huge shock. The girl may seek
    advice elsewhere, for example from her GP, a health centre or a family planning
    service, to avoid facing the music at home.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/9\">Advice on
    abortion may be provided and accepted without the parents' knowledge. Just a few
    weeks ago, I received a letter from a constituent who had been required to leave
    his place of work, find a chemist and buy a tube of antiseptic cream, go to his
    son's primary school where the child had grazed his knee, apply the cream and
    then return to work. Apparently that procedure was too risky to be undertaken
    without parental involvement. We live in a contrary world that rates the application
    of cream to a grazed knee, or a visit to the dentist, for which parental consent
    is also required, as a greater risk than an abortion on a minor.</p><p pid=\"\
    c.290.1/10\">For parents, the discovery that their daughter had an abortion that
    might have been avoided if they had not been kept in ignorance can be an even
    greater shock. The long-term emotional and physical impact of an abortion can
    be serious, and it is the parents who will provide care and support for their
    daughter. Those same parents might well have decided to support their daughter
    in bringing up her child, once they had overcome the initial shock of discovering
    their child's pregnancy, and had had time to reflect.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/11\"\
    >That brings me to the main purpose of the Bill. The provision of lots of sex
    information has not worked, so sex information should be replaced with sex education.
    In education about the real risks involved and the likely outcomes, the advice
    to under-age girls should be to abstain, to wait, to delay, and to resist, rather
    than to use contraception and believe that they will not come to any harm. Parents
    need to be part of that process. In 1984-85, under the Gillick ruling, and more
    recently in the United States, where parental involvement is required, the evidence
    showed that the number of unwanted pregnancies did not go up, but the number of
    sexually transmitted infections went down.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/12\">The decision
    to provide contraception or abortion advice or treatment to under-age children
    must involve the parents. It is the parents who have full responsibility for,
    and the greatest interest in, their children's health and welfare and the closest
    long-term personal bonds with them. Parents have the best opportunity to guide
    their children to resist peer pressure, and to make wise decisions about their
    sexual behaviour and their future reproductive lives. Quite simply, parents have
    not just a right to know, but a need to know.</p><p pid=\"c.290.1/13\">There is
    an important caveat in the Bill to protect a child whose parents might be violent
    or abusive. In those circumstances, where the child finds herself in need of advice,
    practitioners may appeal to the courts, in camera, for a decision to be made.
    The Bill would be an important step in trying to reduce the number of unwanted
    teenage pregnancies and abortions among under-age children. It attempts to do
    that by strengthening families and entitling parents to be involved in making
    important decisions.</p>"

  tidied_motion: That this House calls on the Government to set targets for carbon
    emissions informed by science and not political convenience which will help to
    hold global warming to within two degrees of pre-industrial levels; recognises
    that the best current estimate is that this requires stabilisation at between
    400 and 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere;
    and urges Ministers to inject a new sense of urgency into efforts at home by setting
    out an annual action plan to curb the UK's own carbon emissions, establishing
    a climate change committee of the Cabinet to ensure joined up government, tackling
    quickly the most rapidly growing emissions in the transport sector by a more steeply
    graduated vehicle excise duty and a rebasing of air passenger duty onto the emissions
    of each flight, offset by other tax cuts, speeding up the effort to curb the waste
    of energy and the high emissions from buildings not just by raising thermal efficiency
    requirements in new homes but also by renovating existing homes, changing the
    incentives on energy companies so that they make more money by saving and not
    selling more energy, providing comprehensive insulation packages funded mainly
    by energy mortgages repayable through utility bills and setting an example by
    ensuring that all future buildings on the Government's own estate are built to
    the highest energy efficiency standards.

    are not too ashamed of their party's manifesto in the Scottish elections. At least
    some of them are attending the debate, despite the fact that their party scored
    nought out of 10 for its environmental commitments, according to Friends of the
    Earth. The toxic Tories north of the border reminded me of the analysis undertaken
    by Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace of the voting record of Conservative Members
    of the European Parliament on environmental matters during the last Parliament,
    which found that they were not merely the worst of all the British political parties,
    but the worst in the whole of the European Union.</p><p pid=\"b.37.3/4\">Clearly,
    <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932\" name=\"David
    Cameron\">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> has some sins
    still to repent. He has been leader of his party for 16 months and has yet to
    put on the table a single firm proposal that would have any impact on greenhouse
    gas emissions. I hope that his party will be able to support our motion as a first
    step to rectifying that omission. That would also fit with the ambitious agenda
    revealed in <i> The Times</i> today by the Conservatives' policy chief, <phrase

    a set of attitudes, has a specific theoretical agenda. It aims to achieve two
    significant paradigm shifts.</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b.37.3/6\">First, a

    in the theory of the state from a provision-based paradigm to a framework-based

    >I wish that I could argue that the Government's record on climate change has
    been good, but it has not. There is real concern that their aims are not being
    informed solely by the science of climate change, which must surely be the starting
    point. I think that we are agreed across the parties that a rise in global temperature
    of 2&#176; C above the pre-industrial average is at the limit of what should be
    tolerated if we are to avoid dangerous climate change, with rising sea levels,
    drought, floods and extreme weather events. However, the Government have been
    less than open about what that temperature limit means for our behaviour. They
    have drifted towards a figure of 550 parts per million of carbon dioxide alone
    as the aim of our emissions policy globally. We now know what that would mean
    according to the latest&#8212;the fourth&#8212;assessment report of working group
    3 of the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change, which was published
    yesterday in Bangkok. The working group is responsible for assessing what we need
    to do to limit global warming. It finds that a range of 485 to 570 parts per million
    of carbon dioxide alone&#8212;in other words, what the Government have been suggesting&#8212;would
    lead to a global mean temperature increase of not 2&#176; C, but 3.2&#176; to
    4&#176; C. The top end of that range is nearly double the 2&#176; C that the Government
    specify. The same report shows that holding global warming to 2&#176; to 2.4&#176;
    C would require a CO2 equivalent concentration of 445 to 490 parts per million.</p><p
    pid=\"b.37.3/9\">Clearly, there is a great disjuncture between the Government's
    rhetoric in saying that they want to avoid dangerous climate change and the reality
    of the targets that they set. On the basis of the evidence of the report, if the
    Government continue to believe&#8212;as they should&#8212;that 2&#176; C of global
    warming is the danger threshold, they must also accept a revision of their international
    aim and, indeed, a revision of the 60 per cent. reduction in emissions in the
    draft Climate Change Bill. I hope that Ministers can tell the House exactly where
    the Government stand on the matter, as the United Nations IPCC report makes it
    clear that their current position is no longer tenable.</p><p pid=\"b.37.3/10\"\
    >No doubt there will be much hand-wringing in parts of British business at the
    prospect of a more ambitious target, but we have much to gain by being ahead of
    the global pack. The countries that establish first mover advantage will have
    the proprietary technology to give their exporters an edge in new global markets.
    Energy saving does exactly what any sensible business does anyway: it saves costs.
    The Stern review has already stated that we would benefit by moving more quickly
    rather than allowing higher costs to build up later. The UN IPCC report reaches
    similar conclusions. The costs of the most radical stabilisation proposal are
    put at no more than 0.12 per cent. of GDP each year, or less than 5.5 per cent.
    of the GDP level in 2050.</p>"

    principle for holding such an inquiry, I make no apology for returning to it now.
    The motion calls for agreement to the principle that an inquiry of the kind led
    by Lord Franks into the Falklands war should be established. It does not of itself
    specify the timing or any further details and it therefore provides the opportunity
    for the Government to make clearer their own thinking or to come up with their

    parliamentary approval for decisions to go to war. On that occasion, the Government
    responded constructively by accepting the principle and promising to produce detailed
    proposals and to consult the Opposition parties in the meantime. It was to be
    hoped that the Government would respond in similar fashion to this debate, which
    is in effect an invitation to them to set out in more detail inside the House
    their thinking on an inquiry that several Ministers have been happy to say they
    favour when outside the House.</p><p pid="b.532.3/5">The last time we debated
    these matters, the Foreign Secretary managed to get through the debate without
    conceding that a major inquiry would be held, only for the Defence Secretary to
    say, within minutes of the end of the debate,</p><p class="indent" pid="b.532.3/6">"When
    the time is right of course there will be such an inquiry".</p><p pid="b.532.3/7">If
    the Government believe that there will be such an inquiry, there is no reason
    for them not to accept the principle of it today. That is all that the motion
    calls for. In addition, the Leader of the House said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-23">23
    February</phrase>:</p><p class="indent" pid="b.532.3/8">"I think we have all made
    clear there will be an inquiry in due course",</p><p pid="b.532.3/9">perhaps forgetting
    that the Foreign Secretary had not made that clear when the matter was debated&#8212;and,
    indeed, had refused to do so.</p><p pid="b.532.3/10">As the candidates for the
    Labour deputy leadership have travelled the country, they have come under a great
    deal of pressure from Labour party activists, leading them all to say, in various
    ways, either that there will be an inquiry or that there should be one. <phrase
    class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" name="Jon Cruddas">The hon.
    Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase> said:</p><p class="indent" pid="b.532.3/11">"I

    people and actually we have an opportunity over the next three months with the
    new leadership to turn the page on this."</p><p pid="b.532.3/12">I therefore hope
    that, even though the Government have tabled more or less the same amendment to
    our motion as they did in October, the Foreign Secretary will recognise in her
    speech the gathering consensus in British politics and that she will decide to
    become part of it. Last time, she did not commit the Government to a major inquiry.
    If she does not do so this time, she will be at variance with many of her Cabinet
    colleagues.</p>

    proposals and to consult the Opposition parties in the meantime. It was to be
    hoped that the Government would respond in similar fashion to this debate, which
    is in effect an invitation to them to set out in more detail inside the House
    their thinking on an inquiry that several Ministers have been happy to say they
    favour when outside the House.</p><p pid="b.532.3/5">The last time we debated
    these matters, the Foreign Secretary managed to get through the debate without
    conceding that a major inquiry would be held, only for the Defence Secretary to
    say, within minutes of the end of the debate,</p><p class="indent" pid="b.532.3/6">"When
    the time is right of course there will be such an inquiry".</p><p pid="b.532.3/7">If
    the Government believe that there will be such an inquiry, there is no reason
    for them not to accept the principle of it today. That is all that the motion
    calls for. In addition, the Leader of the House said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-23">23
    February</phrase>:</p><p class="indent" pid="b.532.3/8">"I think we have all made
    clear there will be an inquiry in due course",</p><p pid="b.532.3/9">perhaps forgetting
    that the Foreign Secretary had not made that clear when the matter was debated&#8212;and,
    indeed, had refused to do so.</p><p pid="b.532.3/10">As the candidates for the
    Labour deputy leadership have travelled the country, they have come under a great
    deal of pressure from Labour party activists, leading them all to say, in various
    ways, either that there will be an inquiry or that there should be one. <phrase
    class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" name="Jon Cruddas">The hon.
    Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase> said:</p><p class="indent" pid="b.532.3/11">"I
    do see the case for an inquiry as part of an overall reconciliation with the British
    people and actually we have an opportunity over the next three months with the
    new leadership to turn the page on this."</p><p pid="b.532.3/12">I therefore hope
    that, even though the Government have tabled more or less the same amendment to
    our motion as they did in October, the Foreign Secretary will recognise in her
    speech the gathering consensus in British politics and that she will decide to
    become part of it. Last time, she did not commit the Government to a major inquiry.
    If she does not do so this time, she will be at variance with many of her Cabinet
    colleagues.</p>

    from 2007 to 2013. That agreement was in our long-term national interest. It is
    good for Britain and good for Europe, and today I shall explain why. It is good
    for Britain because it not only preserves our rebate but will see it rise in value
    during the next six years. It is good for Europe because it provides investment
    to help the emerging economies of eastern Europe prosper, which in turn and in
    time will benefit our own economy, as have all previous EU enlargements. The Bill
    will help to pay for European enlargement.

    and full engagement with the European Union is good for Britain and good for Europe;
    and we believe that the treaty is good for Britain and good for Europe, too.</p><p
    pid="d.1239.4/3">The treaty is the fifth such treaty since the late Edward Heath
    negotiated the UK's entry to the EU in 1973. Lady Thatcher's Single European Act
    of 1986 set out the blueprint to complete the single market, provided for co-operation
    in foreign policy and created the concept of the convergence of economic and monetary
    policies. John Major's treaty of Maastricht in 1992 created economic and monetary
    union, the common foreign and security policy, and co-operation on justice and
    home affairs. Tony Blair's 1997 treaty of Amsterdam streamlined decision making
    and added provisions on social policy and employment, while the treaty of Nice
    in 2001 adjusted the EU's institutions to pave the way for enlargement. As I will
    describe, the treaty will improve the way in which the EU works. It will adapt
    the EU's institutions to a Union of 27, and ensure that the voice of Europe's
    nations is heard more loudly in foreign policy. It brings national Parliaments
    into day-to-day decision making to strengthen subsidiarity and focuses the EU
    on the big external challenges from climate change to migration.</p>

    as a triumph when it contains so much that the Government so vociferously objected

  question: ' Question put:—'
  tidied_motion: That the draft Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 (Continuance in force
    of sections 1 to 9) Order 2008, which was laid before this House on 30th January,
    be approved.
  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="b.561.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="indent" pid="b.561.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That the draft Prevention of
    Terrorism Act 2005 (Continuance in force of sections 1 to 9) Order 2008, which
    was laid before this House on 30th January, be approved.</p><p pid="b.561.2/3">The
    purpose of the order is to renew the control order elements of the Prevention
    of Terrorism Act 2005, which automatically lapses after one year unless renewed
    by order subject to affirmative resolution in both Houses. The effect of the order
    is to maintain the powers set out under the Act until the end of <phrase class="date"
    code="2009-03-10">10 March 2009</phrase>. That will allow us to continue to use
    control orders to tackle the threat posed to national security by suspected terrorists
    whom we can neither prosecute nor deport.</p><p pid="b.561.2/4">I am conscious
    of the limited time, and I will try to be as quick as I can, but it is important
    to put the threat that we face in context. As hon. Members know, in the past few
    years, we have witnessed several appalling attacks on our country. As the director
    general of the Security Service stated in November last year:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="b.561.2/5">"The number of people...involved in terrorist-related activity
    in the UK has increased to at least 2,000. And we suspect that there are as many
    again that we don't yet know of."</p><p pid="b.561.2/6">The threat is clearly
    genuine, serious and unparalleled in our country's history. It is unparalleled
    because of the suicide dimension, which is new.</p><p pid="b.561.2/7">Faced with
    a threat of that magnitude, it would be irresponsible to say that there was a
    simple solution. We need a range of responses to reduce the risk of further terrorist
    attacks. The order should be viewed in that context.</p><p pid="b.561.2/8">I freely
    admit that the balance between human rights and security is paramount and that
    no party in the House has the monopoly on supporting security or human rights.
    All hon. Members accept that we all seek that balance. We must ensure that we
    protect all our fundamental values and civil liberties while defending the most
    of important&#8212;the right to life.</p><p pid="b.561.2/9">Let me make it clear
    that prosecution is&#8212;first, second and third&#8212;the Government's preferred
    approach when dealing with suspected terrorists. Somehow in the past, a view has
    been put abroad that we cannot be bothered to prosecute so we invented control
    orders to avoid that route. In 2007 alone, 37 people were convicted of terrorism-related
    offences in 15 cases.</p><p pid="b.561.2/10">However, we are constantly seeking
    to improve our ability to prosecute suspected terrorists. First, as hon. Members
    know, we introduced new offences in the Terrorism Act 2006, which have already
    been used successfully to prosecute those involved in terrorism. Secondly, we
    propose measures in the Counter-Terrorism Bill to extend post-charge questioning
    of suspected terrorists. Thirdly, we have accepted the Chilcot recommendation
    that we should introduce intercept as evidence, provided that the conditions outlined
    can be met. However, as the Chilcot report states:</p><p class="indent" pid="b.561.2/11">"We
    have not seen any evidence that the introduction of intercept as evidence would
    enable prosecutions in cases currently dealt with through control orders."</p><p
    pid="b.561.2/12">Two other proposals made in last year's renewal debates&#8212;about
    the use of the threshold test and turning Queen's evidence&#8212;are already in
    place.</p>

    I thought we would. I can conclude only that the Conservatives have some reason
    for delaying its start&#8212;perhaps they do not want to talk about their chaotic
    policy on Heathrow and aviation. I note that an eight-minute limit on speeches
    applies, so it was rather unfair to take 15 minutes away with an unnecessary Division.</p><p
    pid="b.836.2/4">The Government's policy on aviation is described in their amendment

    aviation strategy".</p><p pid="b.836.2/6">I wonder whether the person who wrote
    that had any shame&#8212;I do not know whether it was written by a Minister, a
    Whip or an official in the Department for Transport&#8212; whether the Government
    are past that stage or, indeed, whether, as with much of the consultation paper,
    it was in fact written by someone from BAA plc, with glee rather than with shame.</p><p
    pid="b.836.2/7">As far as aviation is concerned, it seems that the Government
    live in a sort of bubble, in which climate change does not exist. The rest of
    Government policy is designed to drive down carbon emissions, making a 60 or 80
    per cent. cut by 2050, but aviation somehow does not come into that picture and
    has to live on its own. I am interested in the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend"

    on 1st April 2009 unless the Secretary of State has made regulations under the
    Gambling Act 2005 which permit up to one-fifth of the gaming machines in bingo
    halls and arcades to be Category B3 machines (as defined in regulations made under
    section 236 of that Act).'.</p><p pid="c.75.1/3">Amusement machine licence duty
    is important not only to the many small businesses that are involved in gaming
    arcades up and down the country, but, further up the supply chain, to the various
    manufacturers and companies that service gaming machines. It is also important
    to the Treasury. It raised around &#163;208 million in tax revenue for the Treasury
    in the financial year 2006-07, according to the British Amusement Catering Trade
    Association. Indeed, the association estimates that the industry's overall contribution
    through gaming arcades and the gaming machines that are also in bingo halls, for
    example, is even greater. The industry employs 26,000 people directly, so when
    employment taxes&#8212;for example, national insurance and PAYE&#8212;are included,
    the estimated total tax revenue from amusement arcades is a substantial &#163;600
    million.</p><p pid="c.75.1/4">Against that backdrop, the industry described the
    further increase in this year's Budget in amusement machine licence duty as a
    "missed opportunity", given the pressures that it faces as a result of the Gambling
    Act 2005, which was effected last September. The amendment is intended directly
    to assist an industry that is under pressure, and to strengthen the Treasury's
    ability to ensure that we retain a successful gaming and arcade industry, which
    can continue to contribute to the Exchequer.</p><p pid="c.75.1/5">The amendment
    would enable gaming arcades to have up to one fifth of their gaming machines as
    B3 machines, and unless the provision was in place by April next year, this year's
    Budget increases in amusement machine licence duty would lapse. The amendment
    would force the Government to revisit allowing more B3 machines per establishment
    than the current rules in the Gambling Act permit. The new rules restrict establishments
    to a maximum of four machines, irrespective of the venue's size. The Act also
    introduced a further change, reducing the maximum stake on B3 machines from &#163;2
    to &#163;1, which has meant a dramatic fall in the turnover of gaming arcades.</p><p
    pid="c.75.1/6">Although the debate is about amusement machine licence duty, to
    explain my amendment properly and so that hon. Members at least understand my
    rationale for tabling it I need briefly to outline the dramatic effects of the
    Gambling Act. I could have tabled a further amendment on increasing the current
    limited stake from &#163;1 to &#163;2 for a &#163;500 maximum prize on B3 machines,
    which the Gambling Act reduced. However, I believe that the amendment will give
    me the chance to make plain my concerns about the viability of the gaming arcade
    industry and the impact on the economies that it supports.</p><p pid="c.75.1/7">Many
    people who are involved in the gaming arcade industry have serious concerns about
    even its short and medium-term viability, if my amendment is not accepted. Those
    anxieties are especially prevalent in seaside communities, where a much larger
    base of the local economy is linked to tourism and the entertainment industry
    generally.</p>

    Speaker, I understand that you and the spokesmen for the Opposition parties have
    been informed that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment,
    Food and Rural Affairs sends his sincere apologies for his absence. He is unwell,
    but it is temporary and he will be back at work very soon. He has asked me to
    stand in for him.</p><p pid="c.37.3/3">Every Member of this House knows of the
    urgent need to prevent dangerous climate change. The science is clear and is now
    widely accepted and understood. Last autumn, the fourth assessment report of the
    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told us unequivocally that the world's
    climate is warming, that human activity is by far the principal cause, and that
    without global action to reduce emissions, we face an increase in average temperatures
    of up to 4&#176;C by the end of the century. What would that mean? It would mean
    too much water, not enough water, conflict over water and food, people moving
    across the earth looking for somewhere to live, economic disruption and a real
    risk of reaching the point at which abrupt or irreversible climate change happens.</p><p
    pid="c.37.3/4">The effects are already being felt. The World Health Organisation
    tells us that 150,000 people are already dying each year from climate change.
    The United Nations estimates that all but one of its emergency appeals in 2007
    were to do with the climate&#8212;in Darfur, for example, where shifts in rainfall
    have made the conflict worse as people compete for grazing land.</p><p pid="c.37.3/5">As
    Nick Stern said in his hugely influential report on the economics of climate change:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="c.37.3/6">"The benefits of strong, early action on climate
    change outweigh the costs".</p><p pid="c.37.3/7">The benefits include not only
    avoiding devastating economic and human cost&#8212;the equivalent of world war
    one, world war two and the great depression put together&#8212;but enormous economic
    opportunities for those companies and countries that adapt and innovate in leading
    the new industrial revolution, the low-carbon revolution.</p>

    the end of term spirit to a very serious issue, which is the motion to annul statutory
    instrument No. 3020 relating to value added tax. There are two reasons to be concerned
    about the VAT change, and we want to register that fact from the Opposition Benches.
    Some people do not believe that there should be a fiscal stimulus or think that
    it would be damaging; I expect the Conservatives to make that case in due course.
    My approach and that of my colleagues is somewhat different: we have no objection
    to the principle of a fiscal stimulus, but we think that this is a bad one that
    is not likely to be effective even on its own terms.</p><p pid=\"c.1133.1/4\"
    >Perhaps I should start with the Chancellor's own language in the pre-Budget report,
    when he declared:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"c.1133.1/5\">\"I have decided that
    the best and the fairest approach is a measure which will help everyone\"&#8212;[<phrase
    class=\"offrep\" id=\"debates/2008-11-24.483\"><i> Official Report</i>, 24 November
    2008; Vol. 495, c. 483</phrase>.]</p><p pid=\"c.1133.1/6\">and said that he proposed
    to give back some &#163;12.5 billion to consumers. Our view is that that is not
    the best and fairest approach, that it will not help everyone, and that it certainly
    will not give &#163;12.5 billion back to consumers. That is not to say that it
    is completely hopeless. There is a case for providing a fiscal stimulus through
    this measure that does not rely on \"best\" or \"fairest\" or consumer stimulus.
    It is a somewhat mechanical approach. What will happen&#8212;we can already see
    it happening&#8212;is that this measure will be absorbed in increased retail margins
    for everything from small shops to Sainsbury's, Asda and Tesco. Of course, that
    is putting money into the economy; no doubt if Tesco earns a little bit more profit
    as a result, that will be reflected in its share price and feed through into pension
    funds. If the Government had been honest with us and said, \"Actually, this has
    got nothing to do with helping the consumer&#8212;it's all about putting &#163;12.5
    billion into the economy in the quickest way we can think of, and it's marginally
    better than dropping money from helicopters\", we would find it difficult to quarrel
    with the logic. However, they have not done that&#8212;they have grossly overstated
    their case, and so we need to have a look at it and at its weaknesses.</p><p pid=\"\
    c.1133.1/7\">The policy makes extraordinarily optimistic assumptions about the
    course of the economy. It assumes, as was said in the pre-Budget report, that
    we expect a recovery in 13 months from now. Because of that very optimistic view
    of the course of the British economy, this measure could have some perverse and
    negative consequences that were clearly not thought through in the Treasury. As
    we approach the end of next year, most people will have to look forward to an
    increase in VAT that may be greater than a return to 17.5 per cent.&#8212;to reopen
    the whole issue of what the Government really intended&#8212;as well as an increase
    in income tax, although it is called national insurance. Most rational consumers
    will calculate that they face a reduction in real income and adjust their budgets
    and spending patterns accordingly.</p><p pid=\"c.1133.1/8\">There is another,
    more subtle effect at work. Most economic forecasters now expect that next year
    we will see something that we have not seen for decades, possibly generations&#8212;namely
    deflation, whereby prices fall as they did in the 1930s and at various times in
    the 19th century. That is now factored into the assumptions of some of the money
    markets, so the Americans talk about it quite openly.</p><p pid=\"c.1133.1/9\"\
    >In a deflationary world, prices fall. When consumers see prices falling, they
    hold back from spending, so the VAT cut has the perverse effect of encouraging
    deflationary expectations. That encourages people to spend less, rather than more.
    Those are two possible perverse consequences of the measure. I am not predicting
    that that would happen, but before we glibly assume that the VAT cut is simply
    an injection of consumer spending, I am pointing out factors that could work in
    the opposite direction.</p><p pid=\"c.1133.1/10\">Secondly, on the impact of consumer
    behaviour, we need to take into account the fact that we are talking about a very
    small change. Mr. Steinbr&#252;ck, the German Finance Minister who has often been
    quoted in the Chamber in the past few weeks, chose a singularly unhelpful example:
    he asked, rhetorically, whether people would respond to a change in the price
    of a DVD from &#163;39.90 to &#163;39.10. That is quite a good example, and I
    can give others: one that I have quoted in the past is the &#163;5 off the &#163;220
    flat-screen TV from China. There is also the example of 60p off a &#163;25 meal.
    One can question how much that is likely to influence the behaviour of a rational
    consumer.</p>"

    have waited a long time to move an amendment on Second Reading.</p><p pid="e.60.0/4">This
    is a hotch-potch of a Bill. A Second Reading debate is supposed to be about the
    principle of the Bill, but it is not clear how a Bill such as this, which at a
    conservative estimate deals with 28 different topics and amends 56 different Acts
    of Parliament can have any single principle at all, apart from being a sort of
    Christmas tree Bill, on to which the Government can hang any topic they think
    useful to debate from the point of view of the all-important media grid, the device
    by which future announcements are planned out for the year in advance and by which
    this country has been governed for the past 12 years<i> .</i><i> </i><i> [Interruption.]</i>
    The Secretary of State says if only life were like that, but to a great extent
    it has been like that; it has just been a matter of people getting their slot
    in the grid at the right time.</p><p pid="e.60.0/5">The other principle of legislative
    drafting that the Bill seems to follow is that of the red rag and the smuggle.
    A red rag is a provision in a Bill that is designed to attract the attention of
    hot-headed Members of this House, and about which the Government do not, in reality,
    care very much either way, while they smuggle in, largely unnoticed and unchallenged,
    a lot of significant stuff that otherwise might attract severe criticism. The
    problem with this Bill is that it is not entirely clear which provisions are the
    red rags and which are the contraband. Working on the general principle that to
    avoid scrutiny in Committee, the usual tactic is to put the contraband at the
    end and the red rag at the start, my guess is that the provisions on data sharing
    are the contraband and those on secret inquests are the red rag.</p><p pid="e.60.0/6">That
    is why I am going to start by discussing the provisions on data sharing, especially
    in the light of this morning's news that yet more personal information has been
    lost&#8212;this time with regard to the British Council. It is right to say that
    data sharing can be a good thing&#8212;I would not deny many of the remarks made
    by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" name="Alun Michael">the
    right hon. Member for Cardiff, South and Penarth (Alun Michael)</phrase>&#8212;but
    there is a massive downside and we need to bear in mind that it massively increases
    the risks if data are lost.</p><p pid="e.60.0/7">Clause 152 would create amazingly
    broad exemptions to the principles of the data protection legislation. If the
    issue were specific exemptions from specific powers, it would be a different matter,
    but it is not. The Bill would allow Ministers to authorise data sharing between
    any person and any other person, regardless of what any other legislation&#8212;apart
    from the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000&#8212;says. So that would
    be despite what the data protection and the human rights legislation say about
    privacy. Under clause 152 in proposed new section 50B(h), a data-sharing order
    would be allowed to "modify any enactment".</p>

    to the families and friends of the two British hostages in Iraq, Jason Swindlehurst
    and Jason Creswell, whose remains were returned to the care of this country at
    the weekend. Their tragic deaths are a reminder that the lives of many British
    citizens are still painfully bound up with developments in Iraq, and that there
    are still three families waiting anxiously for news.</p><p pid="c.800.3/4">This
    is the fourth debate that I have opened on the subject during this Parliament,
    and when I heard that the Prime Minister was set to announce the long awaited
    and much delayed inquiry, I honestly did not expect to have to do so again. This
    debate is different from the previous ones, in that hitherto we have been pressing
    on the Government the need to establish an inquiry; our debate today is in direct
    consequence of the Government's decision, welcome in itself and in principle,
    to hold an inquiry.</p><p pid="c.800.3/5">The need for the debate has arisen from
    the fact that nine days ago the Prime Minister stood here and announced proposals
    for the Iraq inquiry which betrayed both poor advance preparation and inadequate
    consultation, and which as a result received severe and sincere criticism from
    all quarters of the House&#8212;criticism that was reflected in the reaction of
    people throughout the country. There was genuine disappointment that the Prime
    Minister had produced proposals for such a secretive, behind-closed-doors inquiry,
    despite the fact that both of the main Opposition parties had made representations
    to the Government that the proceedings of the inquiry should be much more open
    to public view, and it was accentuated by the fact that only the previous week
    the Prime Minister had talked of improving accountability and transparency.</p><p
    pid="c.800.3/6">Hon. Members on the Government Benches were among those who said
    that they were extremely disappointed that the inquiry would be limited in its
    remit or that they had hoped for a new politics of openness. The points were made
    that the membership was too restricted, quite apart from the timing being so utterly
    cynical and politically motivated, and that the response of the Prime Minister
    to important questions such as whether evidence would be given to the inquiry
    on oath was, to say the least, unsure. It was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478"
    name="Tony Wright">the hon. Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>, who
    is in his place, who put it to the Prime Minister, politely on that occasion,
    that he should regard his statement as</p><p class="indent" pid="c.800.3/7">"the
    beginning of a short process of consultation, so that he can carry the whole House

    then, the Government have engaged in a series of climbdowns&#8212;a U-turn that
    was executed in stages as painful to watch as those of a learner driver doing
    a six-point turn having started off the wrong way down a motorway. The Government
    have performed that U-turn by getting the inquiry chairman himself, Sir John Chilcot,
    to announce the changes that we have all demanded, so that no Minister has had
    to return to the House and admit that the Government were in the wrong. Indeed,
    Sir John is now busily engaged in the very process of consultation with Opposition
    parties and others which a Prime Minister who was doing his job properly would
    have carried out beforehand.</p>

    should say that I indicated that I would update the House at an appropriate time
    when further information came to light.</p><p pid="b.1157.2/4">In our debates
    on what became the Terrorism Act 2006, the Government agreed that there should
    be a requirement for the annual renewal, by order debated in Parliament, of the
    extension of the maximum period of detention of terrorist suspects from 14 to
    28 days. As the House will know, two such orders have been made since the commencement
    of the 2006 Act and the order today renews the maximum period of 28 days for a
    further period of one year, beginning <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-25">25
    July 2009</phrase>.</p><p pid="b.1157.2/5">Over the past 18 months, pre-charge
    detention has been the subject of considerable debate&#8212;that is an understatement&#8212;in
    the House, including during the passage of the Counter-Terrorism Bill last year.
    The issue has been discussed by the Home Affairs Committee and the Joint Committee
    on Human Rights, which is chaired by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon
    (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>. It would not be appropriate for me to go over those discussions
    today, because they have been, and will continue to be, an important contribution
    to the debate.</p><p pid="b.1157.2/6">It is worth reminding ourselves of and reflecting
    on why Parliament agreed the exceptional 28-day limit. As Members will know, terrorist
    investigations are hugely time consuming. The increase from 14 to 28 days was
    necessary primarily as a result of major investigations into the use of encrypted
    computers and mobile phones, complex terrorist networks, the international nature
    of networks, and the use of more, and different, languages. From my perspective
    and that of the Government, public safety is paramount; it is our main responsibility.</p>

    to the climate crisis, and that this is particularly important ahead of the United
    Nations Climate Change summit in Copenhagen if there is to be an international
    agreement which will avert the worst effects of catastrophic climate change; further
    believes that immediate practical responses to the crisis should include a massive
    expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency and a commitment for all homes
    in Britain to be warm homes within 10 years; acknowledges that action taken now
    to tackle the climate crisis will cost less than action taken in the future; notes
    the declared support of Labour and Conservative frontbenchers to the objective
    of the 10:10 campaign which calls for 10 per cent. greenhouse gas emission reductions
    by the end of 2010; agrees that the House will sign up to the 10:10 campaign;
    calls on Her Majesty's Government and all public sector bodies now to make it
    their policy to achieve a 10 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by
    the end of 2010; and further calls on the Government to bring a delivery plan
    before this House by the end of 2009 on how these objectives will be achieved.</p><p
    pid="c.976.2/3">We live in an age of crises, and in recent months the economic
    crisis has most dominated the commentary around the world, the concerns of the
    public and debates here. However, the global ecological and environmental crisis
    poses the greater challenge. In some ways happily, although very belatedly, it
    is now rising to the top of the domestic and international agendas. To put it
    in context, a UN report this year stated that 300,000 deaths a year are attributable
    to climate change, that 325 million people are seriously affected at a cost to
    the global economy of $125 billion a year, and that 4 billion people are vulnerable
    to climate impacts.</p>

    am pleased with the scrutiny and attention that hon. Members have given this important
    Bill. It has been considered for a considerable period in Committee and it has
    been improved in significant ways as a result of its passage through the House,
    including in the addition of protection against dual discrimination, the extension
    of the socio-economic duty to Scotland, the limits on questions about disability
    that can be asked by employers when recruiting, and clarification of the pregnancy
    and maternity provisions. It can be further improved if the research that we have
    commissioned from the Equality Commission on caste can, as we have asked, be completed
    quickly so that if there is need, we can ban caste discrimination through measures
    in the other place.</p><p pid="d.1226.3/3">The Government have a proud history
    of equalities legislation. When this Bill's predecessor, the Equality Act 2006,
    was going through Parliament, there were a number of calls for a new equality
    Bill. This Bill answers those calls. It sets out groundbreaking new laws that
    will help narrow the gap between rich and poor, place equality at the heart of
    what public bodies do, require transparency and therefore action to tackle the
    gender pay gap and outlaw age discrimination outside the workplace. In all those
    ways it will significantly strengthen Britain's equality legislation, which for
    the first time is brought together coherently in one place. It is what we have
    described as a "plain English Bill"-that is to say that the final version will
    have the legal clauses on one side of the page and explanatory notes on the other
    to optimise accessibility.</p>

    and calls on the Government to acknowledge its failure to honour the Military
    Covenant.</p><p pid="a.663.3/3">At the beginning of this debate, our thoughts
    and prayers are very much with the families and friends of Sergeant Paul Fox,
    Rifleman Martin Kinggett and Senior Aircraftman Luke Southgate, who have all given
    their lives in the service of their country in the past week. The sadness that
    we share with their families is mixed-correctly-with pride in their courage and
    devotion to their country.</p><p pid="a.663.3/4">With the 1998 strategic defence
    review, new Labour got off to a relatively good start with the armed forces. The
    1998 SDR was a well-respected document. Moreover, it used a foreign policy baseline,
    not a Treasury baseline, as many of its predecessors had done. That was, and is,
    the right way of conducting such a review. However, the failure to have a review
    for more than 12 years means that our armed forces-as well as Government across
    Whitehall, for that matter-have failed fully to adapt to the increasingly changing
    global security situation.</p><p pid="a.663.3/5">The events of 9/11 fundamentally
    changed the international security environment, while the aftermath of Iraq made
    the planning assumptions of the SDR largely obsolete. Looking back, we can also
    see that the review's ambitions were never fully matched with funding. That has
    meant that for 12 years our armed forces have been operating well beyond what
    they were resourced to do. The truth is that the current Prime Minister as Chancellor
    was never willing fully to fund Tony Blair's wars, and that same sad story has
    been retold time and time again during the Chilcot inquiry.</p><p pid="a.663.3/6">As
    <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">the
    right hon. Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon)</phrase> stated in his evidence, within
    the Ministry of Defence</p><p class="indent" pid="a.663.3/7">"there was quite
    a strong feeling"</p><p pid="a.663.3/8">that the 1998 strategic defence review</p><p
    class="indent" pid="a.663.3/9">"was not fully funded,"</p><p pid="a.663.3/10">and
    that</p><p class="indent" pid="a.663.3/11">"in the subsequent CSR programmes we
    asked for significantly more money than we eventually received".</p><p pid="a.663.3/12">Sir
    Kevin Tebbit said that as permanent secretary he had to operate a permanent crisis
    budget. Former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Walker said that the SDR was underfunded
    by well into &#163;1 billion.</p><p pid="a.663.3/13">In one of his many moving
    farewell speeches, in one of the final pieces of spin of his premiership, Tony
    Blair said that defence spending had remained broadly stable, at 2.5 per cent.
    of GDP, if we take into account Iraq and Afghanistan. In other words, much of
    the burden of the cost of Iraq and Afghanistan was being carried by the core defence
    budget. The truth is that the Ministry of Defence was effectively fighting two
    wars on a peacetime budget.</p><p pid="a.663.3/14">The Treasury's unwillingness
    fully to fund the MOD's 1998 SDR meant that there were big losers across defence
    and a degradation of our capability. Let us look just at the Royal Navy. Time
    and time again since the 1998 SDR, the Navy has been blackmailed into accepting
    cuts to its fleet, to ensure the eventual addition of two new carriers. During
    the 1998 SDR process, the Navy agreed to cut its fleet of 12 attack submarines
    to 10, and its fleet of 35 destroyers and frigates to 32, in return for the promise
    of the two carriers. A decade later we find our Navy with only eight attack submarines,
    with a possible future reduction to only six or seven, and 22 -an astonishingly
    low number-of destroyers and frigates. Maritime commitments have not decreased
    since 1998 but have risen, at a time when our Navy has been slashed, mothballed
    and, in some cases, sold off. There is a similar pattern to be found across all
    three services, including the reserves.</p>

    </p><p pid=\"e.25.4/3\">I begin by welcoming the Deputy Prime Minister to the
    Treasury Bench and to the Government Dispatch Box on what I believe is his speaking
    debut in that role in the House. He takes over from me wide responsibilities for
    the Government's constitutional agenda. As my colleagues and I were, he and his
    ministerial colleagues will be responsible for what is put before the House and
    the country, but in making his decisions and recommendations he will be blessed,
    as I was, by having officials of the highest quality, diligence and-certainly
    with myself-patience. I should like to place on record my thanks to them and to
    all the officials with whom I worked, and to wish the right hon. Gentleman well
    in his endeavours.</p><p pid=\"e.25.4/4\">\"Constitutional agenda\" is an abstract
    term that can have the effect of emptying a room quickly, and not just when I
    am the one making a speech. However abstract, though, it describes something of
    profound importance to the effective running of any society and its political
    system, namely the architecture of power-the rules that set down who can make
    decisions and who can hold in check those who exercise power. In most systems,
    those rules are enshrined in what the Germans call \"black letter law\" and are
    normally subject to special procedures of entrenchment to make it more difficult
    for those with the power of government to misuse it to change the fundamental
    rules of the constitution for narrow partisan ends.</p><p pid=\"e.25.4/5\">We
    in the United Kingdom do not have a single text, a written constitution or any
    protective entrenched procedures. Although I believe that over time we should
    develop a single text, I do not propose or support entrenchment or special procedures
    for constitutional change. However, the absence of entrenchment places a special
    responsibility on those in government not to misuse their power, and wherever
    possible actively to seek and achieve consensus across the House, or to ensure
    that the final decision is made directly by the people in a referendum.</p><p
    pid=\"e.25.4/6\">Of course, the Government must have the power of initiative.
    When we took office in 1997, there had been no successful proposals for constitutional
    change for decades. In contrast, the new Labour Administration had a very large
    agenda: devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; an elected Mayor and
    assembly for London; data protection; freedom of information; the Human Rights
    Bill; phased reform of the Lords; independence for national statistics; reform
    of party funding; and a new system for elections to the European Parliament. All
    but one of those measures, however controversial they may have been at the beginning
    of their legislative journeys, were in the end either approved by consensus across
    the House or endorsed by the people in a referendum, and they are all the better
    for that.</p>"

    opposed during the general election campaign; notes the promise in the Coalition

    to meet this test of fairness, as they fall disproportionately on the hardest-pressed

    of State on 10 June that "those in greatest need ultimately bear the burden of
    paying off the debt"; condemns the failure of the Secretary of State to tell the
    House or local authorities where £504 million of cuts to funding will fall; further
    regrets the failure to consult local government on the allocation of the cuts;
    further notes with regret that the Government's further decisions on the Future
    Jobs Fund, housing and support for neighbourhood policing will weaken the ability
    of local councils to shape and deliver services in their areas; regrets the failure

    &#163;1.165 billion of cuts to local government funding in England in the current
    financial year; regrets the Liberal Democrat members of the Government supporting
    cuts they opposed during the general election campaign; notes the promise in the

    so that all those most in need are protected"; regrets that this programme of
    cuts fails to meet this test of fairness, as they fall disproportionately on the
    hardest-pressed communities; notes with concern the principle set out by the Parliamentary
    Under-Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-10">10 June</phrase>
    that "those in greatest need ultimately bear the burden of paying off the debt";
    condemns the failure of the Secretary of State to tell the House or local authorities
    where &#163;504 million of cuts to funding will fall; further regrets the failure
    to consult local government on the allocation of the cuts; further notes with
    regret that the Government's further decisions on the Future Jobs Fund, housing
    and support for neighbourhood policing will weaken the ability of local councils
    to shape and deliver services in their areas; regrets the failure to make any
    progress on implementing the previous administration's commitment to Total Place,

    was interested to hear the earlier exchanges about Ministers not turning up for
    debates. May I say how disappointed I am that the Secretary of State for Communities
    and Local Government has not bothered to turn up for this one? In 10 years as
    a Minister, I always respected the strong convention in the House that if a shadow
    Secretary of State chose to lead an Opposition day debate, the Secretary of State
    would respond. I am very disappointed that, on the first Opposition day debate
    on a Communities and Local Government topic, the Secretary of State could not
    be bothered to be here. The truth is, of course, that he is too scared to be here.
    He is too scared to explain the series of blunders that he has already made over
    these cuts. He is so scared of defending what he is doing that he prefers to treat
    the House with disdain. So we shall have to make do with the Minister for Housing,
    <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40643" name="Grant Shapps">the
    right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase> instead.</p><p pid="a.722.3/5">I

    and I insisted that building firms who took public money to build social housing
    should train apprentices. When they did so, the current Minister described it
    as ludicrous and counter-productive. We have all seen the minutes of his meeting
    with the Prime Minister's adviser on local government, the leader of Hammersmith
    and Fulham council, at which it was agreed that it was a priority to raise rents
    in the social sector to equalise those between social housing and the private
    sector. So we know where he is coming from-he has got form.</p>

  tidied_motion: That the draft Terrorism Act 2006 (Disapplication of Section 25)
    Order 2010, which was laid before this House on 24 June, be approved.
  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\"b.1006.1/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg
    to move,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b.1006.1/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That the
    draft Terrorism Act 2006 (Disapplication of Section 25) Order 2010, which was
    laid before this House on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2010-06-24\">24 June</phrase>,
    be approved.</p><p pid=\"b.1006.1/3\">Our country has many years' experience of
    dealing with terrorism. Five years after the appalling events of 7/7, the threat
    from Islamist terrorists is well known. The threat from dissident Irish republican
    terrorists has not gone away, and new threats will undoubtedly emerge in future.</p><p
    pid=\"b.1006.1/4\">Terrorism is not just another crime. Its purpose is political,
    its methods are barbaric and its effects can be devastating. For those reasons,
    dealing with terrorism and terrorist suspects cannot be treated in the same way
    as dealing with other crimes and other criminal suspects. The potential loss of
    life from terrorism means that the priority of the police and security agencies
    is to stop attacks happening in the first place. That often means that they have
    to intervene at a very early stage to prevent the terrorists' plans from becoming
    too far advanced, which often means that there has been insufficient time to gather
    enough admissible evidence to charge the suspects. So, uniquely in terrorism cases,
    it is often after arrest that most of the evidential investigation takes place.</p><p
    pid=\"b.1006.1/5\">Furthermore, once arrests have been made the police can be
    presented with an enormous volume of information, which is exacerbated by three
    things: first, modern communications, because of the increasing and more sophisticated
    use of encryption; secondly, globalisation, because of the complexity of international
    terrorist networks and the need for co-operation in often difficult diplomatic
    circumstances; and, thirdly, the ambitions of the terrorists, because of the need
    for forensic examination of the hazardous and volatile materials that many wish
    to use as their weapons.</p><p pid=\"b.1006.1/6\">Unlike Ministers in the previous
    Government, I say that not to make the case for 28 days', 42 days' or 90 days'
    detention before charge, but because I believe that it is important to remember
    during the debate the gravity of the threat that we face, and the difficulty of
    the job done by the police and the intelligence and security services.</p>"

    diplomatic voice for the European Union collectively on issues on which the EU,

    Second Reading marks the first legislative step towards the fulfilment of our
    manifesto commitment to improve England's education system. It grants greater
    autonomy to individual schools, it gives more freedom to teachers and it injects
    a new level of dynamism into a programme that has been proven to raise standards
    for all children and for the disadvantaged most of all.</p><p pid="b.24.2/3">The
    need for action to transform our state education system has never been more urgent.
    In the past 10 years, we have seen a decline in the performance of our country's
    education in comparison with our competitors. We were, 10 years ago, fourth in
    the world for the quality of our science education; we are now 14th. We were,
    10 years ago, seventh in the world for the quality of our children's literacy;
    we are now 17th. And we were, 10 years ago, eighth in the world for the quality
    of our children's mathematics; we are now 24th. At the same time as we have fallen
    behind other nations, we have seen a stubborn gap persist between the educational
    attainment of the wealthiest and the opportunities available to the poorest.</p><p
    pid="b.24.2/4">Pioneering work by Leon Feinstein for the Institute of Education
    has proven that educational disadvantage starts even before children go to school
    and that children of low cognitive ability from wealthy homes overtake children
    of greater cognitive ability from poorer homes even before they arrive at school.
    As they go through school, the gap widens. Schools, instead of being engines of
    social mobility and guarantors of equality, are only perpetuating the divide between
    the wealthy and the poorest. At key stage 1, some 71% of pupils who are eligible
    for free school meals are reading at the expected level, compared with 87% of
    pupils who are not eligible for free school meals. At the end of key stage 2,
    the gap has grown wider. By the end of primary school, just 53% of pupils who
    are eligible for free school meals reach level 4-the expected level in English,
    compared with 76% of pupils who are not eligible for free school meals.</p><p
    pid="b.24.2/5">As students go through secondary school, the gap becomes even wider.
    By the time they are taking their GCSEs, just 27% of pupils who are eligible for
    free school meals get five A to C grades, including English and maths. That is
    exactly half the figure for those students who are not eligible for free school
    meals. When it comes to A-levels and university entry, the gap is wider still.
    In the last year for which we have figures, of the 81,000 who had been eligible
    for free school meals, just 45 made it to Oxbridge by the time they turned 19,
    whereas one top London school gets an average of 82 Oxbridge admissions a year.
    We cannot go on with such a drastic waste of talent, which is why we need to legislate
    now to ensure that opportunity becomes more equal in our society.</p><p pid="b.24.2/6">As
    well as the legislation that we are bringing forward today, the coalition Government
    are bringing forward a series of changes to transform our educational system.
    We are hoping to transform teaching for the better by doubling the number of graduates
    on the Teach First scheme, which has already been proven to raise attainment,
    particularly in the poorest areas. The expansion of Teach First was backed by
    every party in the House of Commons at the time of the last general election,
    but it is the coalition Government who have found the money to ensure that the
    very best graduates are in the schools that need them most. We will be bringing
    forward proposals to improve the continuous professional development of all teachers
    to ensure that the current crop of teachers-here I agree with the shadow Education
    Secretary that they are among the best ever-can benefit from the best evidence
    available on how to raise attainment.</p><p pid="b.24.2/7">When it comes to attracting
    great teachers, we know that we need to take action on discipline, because the
    biggest single disincentive for talented people going into the classroom is the
    standard of behaviour that they encounter. As a result, the Minister of State,
    Department for Education, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097"
    name="Nick Gibb">the Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb)</phrase>,
    has outlined proposals to change the rules in order to give teachers greater confidence
    on the use of force, greater confidence when they exercise search powers and greater
    protection when false or vexatious claims are made against them.</p><p pid="b.24.2/8">As
    well as changing the rules on discipline, we are conducting a thorough-going reform
    of special educational needs. The Bill makes it clear that in future there will
    be protection for all pupils who have statements when they apply for academy schools,
    so that they are treated on an even keel. We shall have a comprehensive review,
    led by the Minister of State, Department for Education, my hon. Friend <phrase
    class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40113" name="Sarah Teather">the
    Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather)</phrase>, to ensure that the heartache
    suffered by so many children who cannot get the school they need for their special
    needs is addressed.</p><p pid="b.24.2/9">We shall also be taking steps to ensure
    that our children are reading fluently earlier in primary school, and we shall
    be transforming our curriculum and our examinations so that they rank with the
    world's best-less prescription in the curriculum, more rigour in our examinations.</p>

    \ pwmotiontext=\"yes\">We have enjoyed a lively and wide-ranging debate during
    the Bill's progress. I would therefore like to start by thanking all Members who
    have taken part in the four days of debate on what is a short but significant
    Bill-despite its brevity, it makes fundamental changes to Britain for the better.</p><p
    pid=\"c.192.2/3\">The Bill follows the emergency Budget and puts in place many
    of the measures that are necessary to strengthen the economy and ensure fiscal
    discipline. It was a crucial Budget, and this is a crucial Bill because this is
    the time when we finally get to grips with our deficit. The Bill re-establishes
    the credibility of the country to the rest of the world. It shows that where tough
    choices are needed, the Government have the courage to make them, and it provides
    for a fair and productive society.</p><p pid=\"c.192.2/4\">The Budget was tough,
    but it was also fair. It set out a decisive and credible plan to deal with this
    country's record deficit and to tackle the other problems that were left behind:
    a structural deficit &#163;12 billion larger than we had been told; a deficit
    that was the largest in the G20 and second only to Ireland in the European Union;
    one in every four pounds of public spending coming from borrowing; an uncompetitive
    tax environment; and endless complexity and unfairness throughout the tax system.
    Our plan will pave the way for sustainable private sector-led growth, keep interest
    rates lower for longer and protect jobs. It is the right approach for the country.</p><p
    pid=\"c.192.2/5\">Last week the OECD said in its report on the UK:</p><p class=\"\
    indent\" pid=\"c.192.2/6\">\"The comprehensive budget announced by the government
    on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2010-06-22\">22 June</phrase> was courageous
    and appropriate. It was an essential starting point. It signals the commitment
    to provide the necessary degree of fiscal consolidation over the coming years
    to bring public finances to a sustainable path, while still supporting the recovery.\"\
    </p><p pid=\"c.192.2/7\">Despite containing only nine substantive clauses, the
    Bill represents a clear change from the past and a new direction of travel, and
    it meets the three principles of responsibility, freedom and fairness set out
    by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary on Second Reading.</p><p pid=\"c.192.2/8\"\
    >First, the Bill shows that we are taking responsibility for the problems we inherited,
    and it follows a Budget more honest, more transparent and more pragmatic than
    those before it. We have been honest about the scale of the challenge, and we
    have been honest about the actions needed to take it on. If we are to bring down
    the deficit without cutting vital public services, raising VAT is unavoidable.
    We recognise that Members have concerns about that, but for the first time we
    have published analysis of the distributional impacts of Budget measures. It shows
    that fairness underpins the tough choices the Government have taken to tackle
    the deficit.</p>"

    be that after I have spoken that view will be shared by this House.</p><p pid="b.44.5/4">Over
    the period of the previous Labour Government more significant constitutional reform
    was carried out in 13 years than had taken place in the previous 70 years. Although
    some of those reforms initially generated controversy, we actively sought, and
    were able to achieve, a wide cross-party consensus as the proposals went through,
    and they will stand the test of time.</p><p pid="b.44.5/5">Last year, with the
    crisis of confidence in British politics caused by the expenses scandal, to which
    the Deputy Prime Minister referred, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy
    and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, the then Prime Minister, rightly judged that
    the British people should have an opportunity to decide for themselves whether
    there should be a change in voting systems. Legislation to that effect was agreed
    by this House in early February, by a majority of 188. The Liberal Democrats voted
    with the then Government and I am grateful for their support, notwithstanding
    the faint praise for the referendum from the Deputy Prime Minister, who at the
    time-February was a long time ago-described an alternative vote referendum as
    a "miserable little compromise". He is now going to support the "miserable little
    compromise" actively-there are many other bigger miserable compromises that he
    has supported since then. The proposals failed to become law only when they were
    blocked in the other place by the Conservative party.</p><p pid="b.44.5/6">The
    Labour party remains committed to that referendum on the alternative vote. Of
    course, opinions on the merits of voting systems differ within parties and across
    them; I am in favour of AV, but many of my colleagues take a different view. Regardless
    of our personal preferences, the Labour party is united in its belief that the
    people should decide how their Parliament should be elected. Our plans were to
    hold a referendum no later than October next year and for there to be extensive
    consultation before we decided on the exact date. The right hon. Gentleman proposes
    by this Bill that the referendum should take place with a date set, without any
    prior consultation, for next May, to coincide with local and national elections.
    I urge him to consider carefully the legitimate concerns expressed by people of
    all political persuasions, inside and outside this House, about clashing the referendum
    with local and national elections.</p><p pid="b.44.5/7">The exact date of the
    referendum, although important, is a Committee matter. If it had been our only
    concern with this Bill, Labour Members would have enthusiastically supported it
    on Second Reading and left such matters to the Committee stage. However, in the
    four months since he took office, the right hon. Gentleman has shown an extraordinary
    capacity for making the wrong call and for maximising opposition to himself and
    his policies when with a little wisdom-this certainly applies in this case-he
    could have minimised it. He could and should have made the AV referendum the subject
    of a single-issue Bill. Instead he either chose to join, or was suborned into
    joining, that measure with one that is not directly related to it and which could
    and should have been put in a separate Bill.</p>

    of Parliament. So the people who put us here must now see us taking the action
    needed to do that, ensuring that politics is transparent, making certain that
    we can all be held to account, and ultimately, demonstrating to them that we understand
    that they are in charge. This Bill is a major step towards achieving that, because
    it is about the legitimacy of this House and restoring people's faith in how they

  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\"a.209.3/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg
    to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p><p class=\"\" pid=\"a.209.3/2\"\
    \ pwmotiontext=\"yes\">In a statement to the House on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\
    2010-07-06\">6 July</phrase>, I made clear the Government's intention to make
    the civil service compensation scheme affordable and I set out our intention to
    legislate to underpin the negotiations about achieving that. I start by stating
    my unqualified support for the British civil service; I firmly believe that our
    system of a permanent civil service is one of the jewels of our constitution.</p><p
    pid=\"a.209.3/3\">The service's values of political impartiality, recruitment
    and advancement on merit, and the public service ethos are as much to be cherished
    and nurtured today as they ever were. The service is admired throughout the world
    for the way in which it serves the elected Government of the day. A steady stream
    of visitors from other countries send their civil servants to find out how it
    is done here. It is a pleasure, on returning to government-after an 18-year sabbatical,
    in my case-to discover that those virtues and values remain intact.</p><p pid=\"\
    a.209.3/4\">In the latter part of the last Parliament, I was pleased to support
    the previous Government's actions in introducing, rather belatedly, it has to
    be said, civil service legislation-only 154 years after it was promised in the
    Northcote-Trevelyan report, but better late than never. That was an important
    step in ensuring the continuance of an impartial civil service.</p><p pid=\"a.209.3/5\"\
    >I am also delighted to find that the service continues to attract the best and
    the brightest, with the civil service fast stream recognised as one of the most
    prestigious graduate programmes in the country. So the Bill is emphatically not
    an attack on the civil service: it is a necessary measure to deliver fairness
    and affordability in the appallingly challenging fiscal circumstances in which
    the last Government left Britain.</p><p pid=\"a.209.3/6\">It might be helpful
    to the House if I set out some of the history and background to how we have got
    to where we are today. The history of compensation in the civil service is a long
    one, with the first legislation covering it having been passed more than 150 years
    ago. The ability of the state to pay compensation to civil servants on the loss
    of office was created under the Superannuation Act 1859. That Act did not create
    a right to compensation, but it created a framework under which such payments
    could be made. The Superannuation Act 1965 consolidated the previous Acts and
    included provision for the early payment of pensions to those aged 50 or over
    who were asked to take early retirement in the interests of efficiency. The same
    Act repeated the provision of an earlier Act that spelled out that civil servants
    had no legal entitlement or legal right to the benefits referred to in the 1965
    Act, which was itself supplemented by an administrative code that set out the
    payments that a civil servant could expect, making it crystal clear that there
    was no entitlement to such benefits.</p><p pid=\"a.209.3/7\">In the late 1960s
    and early 1970s, the Fulton committee reviewed the position of civil servants.
    Alongside that committee, the joint superannuation committee of the national Whitley
    Council was set up to review the provisions of the 1965 Act. It reported in 1972,
    noting that improvements were needed to the superannuation scheme</p><p class=\"\
    indent\" pid=\"a.209.3/8\">\"to restore to the Civil Service the position it had
    traditionally held as one of the leaders in pension practice.\"</p><p pid=\"a.209.3/9\"\
    >That view was reflected in the Superannuation Act 1972, which granted civil servants
    rights to their pensions. In 1987, the compensation scheme was amended to its
    current form.</p><p pid=\"a.209.3/10\">The previous Administration concluded that
    the current scheme was both unsustainable and indefensible. In the summer of 2008,
    with support from all parts of the House, Ministers embarked on lengthy negotiations
    to reform the compensation scheme. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40212\"\
    \ name=\"Tessa Jowell\">The right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa
    Jowell)</phrase> was one of those Ministers. I think it is fair to say that those
    negotiations were very long drawn out and protracted. I pay tribute to the efforts
    of successive Ministers in trying to achieve an agreed outcome; they really did
    go the extra mile to try to achieve consensus. Arguably, they went too far, because
    the new scheme that was finally agreed in February this year was still out of
    kilter with most of the rest of the public sector and would have been unrecognisable,
    frankly, to anyone in the private sector.</p><p pid=\"a.209.3/11\">The compromises
    that created what I still regard as a hard-to-defend scheme were made with the
    expectation that all six civil service trade unions present at the negotiations
    would agree it. That appeared to have been achieved, but sadly when the agreement
    was referred back to the leadership of the Public and Commercial Services Union-the
    biggest and most numerous union, representing very largely lower-paid civil servants-the
    rug was pulled from under the feet of the lead PCS negotiator and the agreement
    was rescinded. So after 18 months of tortuous negotiations, with perhaps an excess
    of flexibility on the part of the then Government, consensual reform of the scheme
    seemed as far away as ever. Ministers then took the view, correctly, that PCS's
    last-minute volte-face could not be allowed to stand in the way of much-needed
    reform. Therefore, with the agreement of five out of the six unions, the right
    hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood laid the necessary order to give effect
    to the reformed scheme.</p><p pid=\"a.209.3/12\">I have at all times made clear
    our view that the February scheme did not go far enough. Had it come into effect,
    however, when the coalition Government took office in May this year, a pressing
    case would have been made to let it remain in force. Sadly, that option simply
    did not exist. PCS unilaterally, and without the support of the other five trade
    unions, sought and obtained judicial review and obtained an order that quashed
    the February scheme. The option of allowing the scheme agreed and negotiated by
    the last Government was removed from the table by PCS's unilateral action.</p>"

    police powers and imposing elected commissioners to replace police authorities,
    thus condemning the police service to unnecessary, unwelcome and costly re-structuring
    at a time when their focus should be on maintaining the fall in crime and anti-social
    behaviour.</p><p pid=\"c.343.3/3\">The previous Government were the first since
    the end of world war one to leave office with a lower level of crime and disorder
    than when they came into power. In a previous debate when I mentioned that fact,
    the Home Secretary challenged it by rather bizarrely mentioning Michael Howard-now
    the noble Lord Howard of Lympne-who may have been many things, but was not a Government.
    Although it is true that the noble Lord Howard-recently much derided by his former
    colleagues-was the only Conservative Home Secretary in 18 years to preside over
    any reduction in crime at all, it was a modest reduction, to 4.6 million crimes
    a year, compared with 2.3 million in 1979, when the Conservatives were elected.
    In other words, without Lord Howard's contribution, crime under the Tories would
    have more than doubled; thanks to him, it merely doubled, with violent crime rising
    by 168% and robbery by 405%.</p><p pid=\"c.343.3/4\">The Conservative party that
    presided over that truly miserable record refuses to acknowledge the tremendous
    work of the police and other agencies in tackling its legacy. The Conservatives
    can no longer deny that crime has fallen, including violent crime, so they resort
    to saying that crime is still too high-and they are right: it is. But when they
    were in power, the chances of being a victim of crime were 40%; now it is 21.5%,
    the lowest since records began. The latest statistics, published by the new Government
    in July and covering 2009-10, confirm the trend. Both recorded and surveyed crime
    continued to fall, by around 9%, through the deepest global recession in the post-war
    era, thus effectively destroying the theory of Lord Howard's fiercest critic,
    and probably his most feeble predecessor, the current Justice Secretary, that
    crime fell under Labour only because the economy improved.</p><p pid=\"c.343.3/5\"\
    >The purpose of today's debate is to set out why that record of success is being
    jeopardised and to highlight three specific areas: first, the Home Secretary's
    failure to stand up to the Treasury and insist that policing and counter-terrorism
    be prioritised in the comprehensive spending review; secondly, her determination
    to restrict the ability of the police and other agencies to use DNA, CCTV and,
    now we discover, antisocial behaviour orders to deter and catch miscreants; and
    thirdly, the dogmatic pursuit of the abolition of police authorities and their
    replacement by a single elected commissioner.</p><p pid=\"c.343.3/6\">In respect
    of the CSR, we know that some Secretaries of State are arguing vociferously for
    their Departments, but the one with the best argument is apparently content to
    take a 25% to 40% cut in her budget. Before Government Members seek to intervene
    on me with their Chief Whip crib sheets-subtitled \"Patrick McLoughlin's route
    to a ministerial career\"-let me say that if Labour had won the general election,
    the Home Office budget would have been cut and the police would have had to make
    savings. That is not a matter for conjecture: &#163;1.3 billion of savings that
    we would have implemented by 2013 are itemised in last year's pre-Budget report,
    the Budget, last November's policing White Paper and other public documents.</p>"

    of greater importance. The putting at risk of the lives of our brave service men
    and women in a foreign land needs to be the concern of Parliament, and that alone
    would have been reason enough to select the subject of Afghanistan. As I have
    said, however, there is a second reason. Parliament has not previously had a chance
    to debate the war in Afghanistan on a substantive motion, and the Committee felt
    that there should be a debate in which the views of Parliament could be heard
    and the House could, if it wished, divide. It is encouraging that so many Members
    wish to speak, and that three amendments have been tabled by Back- Bench Members
    of four political parties.</p>

    \ id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/member/40461\" name=\"Graham Allen\">the hon. Member
    for Nottingham North (Mr Allen)</phrase>, for its report on the Bill. The Committee
    has raised a number of important issues in its report that I shall seek to address
    one by one in my comments today.</p><p pid=\"b.621.4/3\">The Bill has a single,
    clear purpose: to introduce fixed-term Parliaments to the United Kingdom to remove
    the right of a Prime Minister to seek the Dissolution of Parliament for pure political
    gain. This simple constitutional innovation will none the less have a profound
    effect because for the first time in our history the timing of general elections
    will not be a plaything of Governments. There will be no more feverish speculation
    over the date of the next election, distracting politicians from getting on with
    running the country. Instead everyone will know how long a Parliament can be expected
    to last, bringing much greater stability to our political system. Crucially, if,
    for some reason, there is a need for Parliament to dissolve early, that will be
    up to the House of Commons to decide. Everyone knows the damage that is done when
    a Prime Minister dithers and hesitates over the election date, keeping the country
    guessing. We were subjected to that pantomime in 2007. All that happens is that
    the political parties end up in perpetual campaign mode, making it very difficult
    for Parliament to function effectively. The only way to stop that ever happening
    again is by the reforms contained in the Bill.</p><p pid=\"b.621.4/4\">As we hammer
    out the detail of these reforms, I hope that we are all able to keep sight of
    the considerable consensus that already exists on the introduction of fixed-term
    Parliaments. They were in my party's manifesto, they have been in Labour party
    manifestos since 1992, and although this was not an explicit Conservative election
    pledge, the Conservative manifesto did include a commitment to making the use
    of the royal prerogative subject to greater democratic control, ensuring that
    Parliament is properly involved in all big, national decisions-and there are few
    as big as the lifetime of Parliament and the frequency of general elections.</p>"

  tidied_motion: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to exempt public houses and
    private members' clubs from the requirements of part 1 of the Health Act 2006
    relating to smoke-free premises; and for connected purposes.

    class="indent" pid="b.332.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring

    of part 1 of the Health Act 2006 relating to smoke-free premises; and for connected
    purposes.</p><p pid="b.332.2/3">Let me first declare an interest, in that I am
    a member of the Salisbury Conservative club in Bury, which is a private members'
    club. In common, no doubt, with many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides
    of the House, I also visit public houses from time to time. I must also declare
    at the outset that I am a devout non-smoker. I have never smoked, and indeed I
    would encourage others not to start smoking. I would also encourage those who
    do smoke to stop. I am entirely persuaded that smoking can cause potentially fatal
    diseases. That said, however, smoking remains entirely legal, and the Treasury
    benefits by many billions of pounds each year from excise duties and VAT on the
    sale of tobacco products.</p><p pid="b.332.2/4">It is now more than three years
    since the outright prohibition on smoking in public places was introduced on <phrase
    class="date" code="2007-07-01">1 July 2007</phrase>. Since that time, the ban
    has been widely accepted in most areas. Although there are arguments for it to
    be completely repealed, this Bill aims to deal with what has perhaps been the
    most contentious aspect of the ban-namely, its application to public houses and
    private members' clubs. This Bill would exempt such premises from part 1 of the
    Health Act 2006 and allow them to reintroduce a smoking room if those in charge
    chose to do so. Smoking would be permitted in a separate room, provided that appropriate
    and effective air extraction equipment was fitted. Smoking would continue to be
    prohibited where food was being served.</p><p pid="b.332.2/5">In considering this
    motion, it is worth recalling that the Labour party's 2005 manifesto stated that</p><p
    class="indent" pid="b.332.2/6">"all restaurants will be smoke-free, all pubs and
    bars preparing and serving food will be smoke-free; and other pubs and bars will
    be free to choose whether to allow smoking or be smoke-free. In membership clubs
    the members will be free to choose whether to allow smoking or to be smoke-free."</p><p
    pid="b.332.2/7">If only the previous Labour Government had stuck to their manifesto
    commitment, there would perhaps have been no need for this Bill.</p><p pid="b.332.2/8">I
    submit that there are two main reasons why the blanket ban should be relaxed and
    smoking should once again be permitted in public houses and private members' clubs.
    First, there is the economic case; and, secondly, there is what I believe to be
    an even more important reason-namely, freedom of choice and the desirability of
    devolving decisions to the lowest appropriate level.</p><p pid="b.332.2/9">Let
    me deal briefly with the economic argument. Since the ban was introduced, thousands
    of public houses have closed down. As ever with statistics, it is possible to
    choose the ones that best suit the desired argument. Few could argue against the
    fact, however, that since the introduction of the smoking ban, thousands of public
    houses have closed down. I do not claim that the smoking ban was the only cause
    of all those closures, as other factors such as the availability of lower-price
    drinks from supermarkets, the cost of satellite television and the general economic
    climate no doubt all played a part. For many, however, the smoking ban was the
    final straw.</p><p pid="b.332.2/10">One does not have to travel very far in my
    constituency to find a public house that has called time for the very last time.
    There are closed public houses in Bury and in Ramsbottom that are now for sale,
    and "To let" signs outside public houses are becoming increasingly commonplace.
    This picture appears to be replicated in constituencies throughout the country.
    When a rural pub or a local community pub closes down, everyone loses out, not
    just those who wish to smoke.</p><p pid="b.332.2/11">Let me turn to deal with
    the second reason-freedom of choice and localism. I believe that in the case of
    a private members' club, the decision should be taken by the members of that club.
    I believe that the decision on whether smoking takes place in a public house should
    be taken by the pub landlord. I believe in trusting the people. This means giving
    individuals the power and the responsibility to take decisions for themselves.</p><p
    pid="b.332.2/12">Pub landlords are the right people to decide whether allowing
    a smoking room is the best thing to do for their establishments. Some would no
    doubt choose to take advantage of the freedom that the Bill would give them, but
    I know from my own constituency that many would not. As smoking would continue
    to be prohibited where food was being served, many public houses would remain
    just as they are today. Customers would have a choice whether to use a completely
    non-smoking pub or to use one with a smoking room. The establishment of separate
    smoking rooms in some pubs would also reduce the incidence of smokers' being forced
    to gather on the pavements outside pubs.</p><p pid="b.332.2/13">The Bill puts
    into practice the principle of localism that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister
    set out with such clarity in his speech to the Conservative party conference last
    week. It transfers power from the state to the citizen, from politicians to people.
    It puts the "local" back into localism, and I commend it to the House.</p>

    I say again that we are dealing with matters of huge significance to large numbers

    them, but where they are inevitable it is important that the terms on which civil
    servants become redundant are fair, both to the individual and to the taxpayer.
    That is what we are seeking to achieve. I say again that the Government will strain
    every nerve to achieve a negotiated new scheme that will make the caps imposed
    by the Bill unnecessary. That would also mean that the power reinstated by the
    Government's new clause and amendment that have just been agreed-which simply
    reinstate a power that previously existed and that was exercised by <phrase class="honfriend"

    pid="b.367.0/4">The effect of the passing of the amendments and new clause is
    that the question of whether this is a money Bill no longer arises, so it will
    move on to the other place and undergo full scrutiny. As I have said, I undertake
    to introduce further amendments there to clarify and entrench, to the extent that
    that is needed, the obligation to consult before any new scheme is imposed. I
    will ensure that that happens and will discuss the content and format of such

    it was when I announced our intention to introduce it back in July. We have made
    huge progress since in configuring what a new replacement successor scheme would
    look like-sustainable, affordable and fair. On that basis, I commend the Bill

    essential to everyday life in the UK. Royal Mail is responsible for collecting
    and delivering letters. It provides a universal service that ensures the collection
    and delivery of letters and parcels from any postbox to any address in the country,
    and all at uniform, affordable prices. The Post Office is an unrivalled network
    of shops spread throughout the country. It allows people local access to essential
    services in the heart of their communities. The aim of this Bill is to secure
    the future of those two institutions and the services that they provide.</p><p
    pid="a.346.2/3">I look forward to support from Labour Members, because I know
    that they genuinely tried in recent years to secure the future of Royal Mail and
    the post office network. They no doubt agree with me that this must be the final,
    successful attempt to conclude that process.</p>'

  tidied_motion: That this House believes that, whilst housing benefit is in need
    of reform, the Government's proposals will mean significant losses for hundreds
    of thousands of working families and pensioners and risk spending an additional
    £120 million on the cost of providing temporary accommodation; and calls on the
    Government to bring forward revised proposals for the reform of housing benefit
    which do not penalise those who have been unable to secure employment within 12
    months, and which ensure that any proposals are implemented on a revised timetable
    which allows councils, tenants and landlords to adjust, allows the impact on rents
    to be observed and understood, and avoids additional spending on temporary accommodation.

    views of many in this House in recognising that the issue of housing benefit cannot,
    and should not, be detached from broader issues of housing provision. However,
    it is important to start the debate by setting out some of the facts that explain
    the real and rising concerns that have been expressed from both sides of the House
    about the impact of the Government's proposed housing benefit changes. I will
    address first the reach of the changes, then the reason for them, and finally
    their potential impact.</p><p pid="a.147.2/4">If we were to believe everything
    we read in the newspapers, we would have thought in recent weeks that housing
    benefit reform is solely a London issue and that it matters only to people who
    have large houses and should be, but are not, working. Broadcasts and newspapers
    have suggested that the key issues are workshy families in Mayfair mansions, so
    let us start with some truths, however inconvenient they are for the Opposition
    Front Bench. Some 4.7 million people in the United Kingdom currently receive housing
    benefit, 2 million of whom are pensioners on pension credit guarantee of just
    about &#163;132 a week, while 500,000 are people on jobseeker's allowance and
    700,000 are people in work in low-paying jobs. From just one measure of the Government's
    proposed changes alone-the cut in local housing allowance from the 50th to the
    30th percentile-700,000 of these, many of the poorest people in our country in
    and out of work, stand to lose on average &#163;9 per week.</p>

    social historians come to study the Post Office/Royal Mail between 1980 and 2010,
    they will wonder how a great British institution, which was exported around the
    world and was copied by other nations, was allowed to go downhill so quickly.
    Successive Governments during those 30 years have to share equal blame. The number
    of post office closures was considerably greater under the previous Labour Government
    than in the years of the previous Conservative Government. In my constituency-I
    am sure that this was repeated around the country-the number of sub-post offices
    was almost halved under Labour Government policies that were both deliberate and
    had unintended consequences. For example, no joined-up government was involved
    when that Government's Department for Work and Pensions put the delivery of Government
    mail out to the private sector. What makes the situation even worse is that the
    final journey of every privatised letter and package delivered in this country
    makes the Post Office/Royal Mail a loss; every private package and private letter
    is subsidised by the public purse.</p>

    but throughout its passage through the House. Hon. Members have rightly spent
    a lot of time scrutinising the detail of our proposals, but I would ask all of
    them to stand back and remember what we are trying to achieve. We are trying to
    preserve two great British institutions-the Royal Mail and the Post Office. As
    we heard from Richard Hooper in his reports, both to the previous Government and
    to this one, unless we take urgent action, the future of the universal postal
    service is at severe risk.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/3\">Letter volumes are declining
    faster than anyone predicted-15% in the past five years alone-and some estimates
    suggest that they could decline by up to another 40% over the next five years.
    Is Royal Mail yet ready for this most challenging of business trends? Without
    the Bill, I believe not, for despite some progress on modernisation, Royal Mail
    has not adapted sufficiently to that market decline. Unless we take action, that
    will only worsen and Royal Mail's position will become even more precarious. Let
    all hon. Members be in no doubt: doing nothing is not an option.</p><p pid=\"\
    a.389.0/4\">The previous Government recognised that, for in many ways the Bill
    is similar to that which was put before the other place by the previous Government
    in 2009. The previous Business Secretary was aware of the need for urgency. He
    said:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a.389.0/5\">\"We cannot simply ignore these
    facts, or put our plans in a bottom drawer\".-[<phrase class=\"offrep\" id=\"\
    lords/2009-03-10.1068\"><i> Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 10 March 2009;
    Vol. 708, c. 1068</phrase>.]</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/6\">Unfortunately, the previous
    Government ended up ignoring the facts. As they oppose the Bill, I suggest that
    the Opposition ought to go back to that bottom drawer. If they look hard enough,
    they might find the bottle that they lost in 2009.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/7\">The
    present Government are aware of the urgency. That is why we have pressed ahead
    with the Bill so early in the Parliament. We will send to the other place a Bill
    that is significantly better than the previous Government's 2009 Bill. It is better
    for employees of Royal Mail, with employee shares to give them a genuine stake
    in the future of the business. It is better for the Post Office, setting it free
    and creating the possibility for a mutual ownership model in the future. Above
    all, it is better for the universal postal service and Royal Mail, as our Bill
    takes a more flexible approach to regulation and is much better structured to
    attract the private investment that this business desperately needs.</p><p pid=\"\
    a.389.0/8\">The House should have no doubt about the overriding aim of the Bill.
    It is to protect the universal postal service. I do not believe it is possible
    to protect that in the public sector any longer-at least, not without ever-increasing
    levels of taxpayer subsidy, which even Lord Mandelson, as he doled out largesse
    in the run-up to the last election, would have baulked at.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/9\"\
    >Royal Mail needs to modernise. Its business is changing with the impact of the
    digital world. I am sure that I was not alone among hon. Members in paying a Christmas
    visit to local delivery offices in my constituency. Not only was I impressed by
    the hard work of Royal Mail employees, dealing with some of the worst weather
    conditions in living memory, but I was staggered by the huge increase in the volume
    and size of parcels. No one, none of the posties there, had seen anything like
    it.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/10\">In recent years, the volume of internet shopping
    has been increasing, especially items such as books and CDs, but now it seems
    that the British consumer's confidence in internet shopping has grown dramatically.
    That is good news for the longer-term future of Royal Mail. Although the increase
    in parcels will not offset the decline in letter mail, and the parcels sector
    is intensively competitive, there is a chance-an opportunity-for Royal Mail to
    grow.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/11\">The other dramatic impression that one has after
    visiting Royal Mail sorting and delivery offices and then visiting similar sites
    elsewhere-as I did in Berlin, visiting a Deutsche Post sorting office-is the lack
    of capital investment in Royal Mail so that it can make the best of this opportunity.
    Since Deutsche Post shares were first sold in 2000, it has invested the equivalent
    of &#163;11.7 billion and about half of that investment has gone on modernising
    its parcels and express business because it knows that that is the future for
    its organisation.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/12\">We need to give Royal Mail that sort
    of freedom to invest in the delivery businesses of the future. We need to ensure
    that it can access capital, not just for its immediate modernisation plans, but
    well into the future. I do not believe that if it remains constrained by Treasury
    borrowing, it could ever access the right amount of cash, with the commercial
    speed needed.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/13\">As we privatise, we are ensuring that the
    employees get a good deal. Our pension plans and our employee share plans must
    represent the best deal on offer to any large group of employees in the UK today.
    I am immensely proud that Liberal Democrats in government with our coalition partners
    are delivering the deal on pensions that Labour failed to deliver, and I am immensely
    proud of the strongest legislative commitment to employee shares in any major
    privatisation.</p><p pid=\"a.389.0/14\">Given the time, I want to say something
    about post offices, but before doing so I shall comment on stamp design. The amendments
    passed by the House will ensure that Her Majesty's head will appear on stamps
    in the future.</p>"

    Bill.\"</p><p pid=\"b.565.0/3\">After all the delays, the false storms, the spin
    and the briefings, finally we have the Bill where it should be-before the House.
    It is a Bill that we will demonstrate over the coming weeks will not, I am afraid,
    revolutionise local politics, empower the masses to shake up their town halls
    or reinvigorate local democracy. It is a Bill that the Business Secretary rightly
    described as \"not thought through\". Above all, the Bill empowers one person:
    the Secretary of State. We believe in devolving power to local communities and
    giving people a real say in how their local area is run: we believe that power
    should rest in the hands of the many, not the few; and we are optimistic because
    we have faith that there are few problems so intractable that local communities
    do not ultimately have the answer.</p><p pid=\"b.565.0/4\">We would welcome and
    support a Bill, therefore, that genuinely devolved powers, which is what the Localism
    Bill was meant to do. We were promised a radical redistribution of power from
    central Government to people -a new dawn for people power and a groundbreaking
    shift in power to councils and communities. We were told that this would be the
    first Government to leave office with much less power in Whitehall than they started
    with. Today we see that that is just another broken promise. If page 1 of the
    Bill gives local councils the power to do whatever they like to improve their
    local areas, why do we need a further 405 pages?</p><p pid=\"b.565.0/5\">This
    Bill fails to live up to its name. For all the Government's talk of localism,
    the Bill does nothing to convince us that it is anything more than a smokescreen
    for unprecedented cuts to local communities up and down the country. All those
    warm words about devolving power and empowering communities ring hollow when,
    at the same time, local councils face cuts that go deeper than in almost any other
    Whitehall Department; cuts that fall heaviest in the first year; cuts that hit
    the most deprived communities the hardest. There is nothing localist about that.</p><p
    pid=\"b.565.0/6\">Let us nail the myth that local councils can spare front-line
    services simply by cutting executive pay, trimming waste and sharing backroom
    functions, because they cannot. I know that maths is obviously not the Secretary
    of State's strong point, because last week he was telling the newspapers about
    how good the Tory canvass returns were looking in Oldham. We support greater transparency
    in the pay of senior officials in the public sector and the measures to increase
    pay accountability in local government, and the right hon. Gentleman does not
    need a calculator to work out that cutting executive pay and streamlining administration
    will not help a single council to avoid cutting front-line services.</p>"

    am grateful to Members who have taken part in debates on the Bill, in particular
    <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40461" name="Graham Allen">the
    hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen)</phrase>, who sadly is not in his
    place, and members of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, who have
    been forensic in their scrutiny.</p><p pid="a.793.0/3">The Bill's reforms are
    an essential part of the Government's drive to modernise Parliament. Currently,
    a Prime Minister can, effectively, call an election on a whim-a situation that
    my colleague and friend, the late Lord Holme of Cheltenham, once described as
    a race in which the Prime Minister is allowed to approach the track with his or
    her running shoes in one hand and the starting pistol in the other. Something
    as important as the timing of a general election must not be determined by the
    whims of Prime Ministers and the self-interest of political parties. I believe
    that all parties agree on that. The Bill proposes the introduction of fixed-term
    Parliaments, bringing a new stability to our political system and, crucially,
    ensuring that when Parliament does dissolve early, that is a matter for this House.</p><p
    pid="a.793.0/4">Debate on the Bill has been vigorous. That is why we allowed extra
    time in Committee. While we may not see eye to eye with colleagues on the Opposition
    Benches on every detail, throughout the debates there was broad agreement on what
    it seeks to achieve.</p><p pid="a.793.0/5">Let me turn briefly to some of the
    issues that have attracted most attention. First, on early dissolution, the Bill
    provides that Parliament will be dissolved early only if at least two thirds of
    MPs vote for dissolution or if a Government are unable to secure the confidence
    of the House of Commons within 14 days of a no-confidence vote-passed on a simple
    majority, exactly as is provided for right now.</p><p pid="a.793.0/6">Those arrangements
    are complementary. They are workable. Most importantly, they strengthen the power
    of Parliament to hold Government to account. We are proposing a new power for
    the House to vote for an early dissolution, as well as, for the first time, giving
    legal effect to the existing procedures for a vote of no confidence. I ask Members
    to note that the Constitution Committee in the other place has endorsed those
    two mechanisms for triggering an early election.</p><p pid="a.793.0/7">The Government
    do not accept the concern that the new right to dissolve Parliament will undermine
    this House's exclusive cognisance. Such an important constitutional innovation
    absolutely should be laid down in statute, but we are confident that the courts
    will continue to regard matters certified by the Speaker as relating to proceedings
    in Parliament, which are, in turn, protected by the Bill of Rights. I was delighted
    that the Constitution Committee-a Committee that includes distinguished parliamentarians
    and lawyers-agreed with the Government's assessment of the Bill's interaction
    with parliamentary privilege.</p><p pid="a.793.0/8">On the length of Parliaments,
    we have looked into the suggestion that four years is preferable to five. It is
    true that this is not an exact science. It is a question of judgment, but, all
    the arguments considered, we remain of the strong view that five years, the current
    maximum and more recently the norm, will encourage the stability and long-term
    perspective that British politics too often lacks.</p>

  question: ' Question put, That the amendment be made.'
  tidied_motion: That this House, while recognising the need to further enhance the
    powers of the Scottish Parliament, nevertheless believes that the measures the
    Scotland Bill seeks to devolve are inadequate to meet the ambitions of the Scottish
    Government for the people of Scotland; considers the measures relating to air
    weapons, road safety and drink driving to be incomplete; regrets that the Calman
    Commission's recommendations to devolve the aggregates levy and air passenger
    duty, and to devolve responsibility for the marine environment to match the Scottish
    Parliament's responsibility for fisheries, as well as its proposal for a Scottish
    role in welfare benefits, have all been abandoned; regards the proposals for the
    Crown Estates Commission as inadequate; deplores the proposals in the Bill to
    re-reserve already devolved responsibilities; concludes that the tax varying provisions
    would embed a long-term deflationary bias in Scotland's budget and that the proposed
    borrowing powers remaining subject to HM Treasury controls and limits render them
    insufficiently flexible; and therefore considers the Bill as a whole to be unacceptable.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="a.478.2/1">Now that we have resolved that little matter,
    I beg to move an amendment, to leave out from "That" to the end of the Question

    Reading of this Conservative-led Government's Scotland Bill, and, like my hon.
    Friends, look forward to debating the further transfer of powers and responsibilities
    to the Scottish Government. The House will find the Scottish National party a
    willing and diligent partner in ensuring that the Bill is debated properly. What
    we have seen today, however, is remarkable. We have seen a Liberal Secretary of
    State for Scotland lead, on behalf of a Conservative-led Government, a debate
    on a Conservative-led Scotland Bill that was initiated in the Scottish Parliament
    by a former leader of the Scottish Labour party. This is cross-Unionist consensus
    in all its Conservative-led glory. I believe that, given the consequent lack of
    scrutiny that will be offered by Her Majesty's Opposition, along with the disappearance
    of what remains of independent thought on the Liberal Benches, the task of scrutinising
    the Bill will be left to the Scottish National party. It is we who will scrutinise
    the Bill in the interests of the Scottish people, and we will do so most diligently
    and sincerely.</p>

    purpose of the Bill can be expressed in one sentence-to improve the health of
    the people of this country and the health of the poorest fastest. While the previous
    Government increased funding for the national health service to the European average,
    they did not act similarly to increase the quality of care. We spent more, but
    others spent better. In important areas, the NHS performs poorly compared with
    other countries. An expert study found that out of 19 OECD countries that were
    investigated, the UK had the fourth-worst death rate from conditions that are
    considered amenable to health care. If NHS outcomes were as good as the EU15 average,
    we would save 5,000 lives from cancer and 4,000 lives from stroke every year.
    We would also prevent 3,000 premature deaths from respiratory disease and 1,000
    premature deaths from liver disease every year. This cannot go on: things have
    to change to protect the NHS and deliver better results for patients.</p>'

    >the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase>, who made such a powerful speech.
    I hope that I am able to tempt her into joining us in the Division Lobby later
    tonight, given what she said about new clause 7. It would be wrong of me not to
    pay tribute to the Whips' Office for allowing me this time tonight, and for arranging
    matters so that my amendment 48 was not debated last week, when there clearly
    was not enough time for it. Now, we have absolutely hours and hours to discuss
    new clause 11, and I congratulate the Whips on that.</p><p pid=\"a.780.3/3\">The
    new clause, which stands in my name and those of other hon. Members, reads:</p><p
    pid=\"a.780.3/4\">\"In order to meet the referendum condition referred to in section
    2, section 3 and section 6 of this Act, the Act providing for the approval of-</p><p
    pid=\"a.780.3/5\">(a) a treaty under the terms of section 2; or</p><p pid=\"a.780.3/6\"\
    >(b) a decision under the terms of section 3; or</p><p pid=\"a.780.3/7\">(c) a
    decision or draft decision under section 6</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a.780.3/8\"\
    >shall also provide for a further binding referendum to be held on continuing
    United Kingdom membership of the European Union, if the majority of those voting
    in a referendum held under the terms of the relevant section are opposed to the
    ratification of the treaty, decision or draft decision, as the case may be.\"
    </p><p pid=\"a.780.3/9\">What does that actually mean? For the first time, this
    Parliament would have an option to debate whether we should have an in/out referendum
    on the European Union. In other words, there would have to be a binding in/out
    referendum on our membership of the European Union if the new clause were passed
    and two hurdles cleared: first, a referendum would have to be triggered under
    the European Union Bill, owing to a proposed transfer of competency; and secondly,
    the British people would have to vote against such a transfer of power.</p>"

    that our country faces in this the second decade of the 21st century-the challenge

    scandal of declining social mobility, and the challenge of how to respond to our
    educational decline, relative to competitor nations.</p><p pid="b.164.2/4">We
    on the Government Benches, both the Conservative and the Liberal Democrat parties,
    believe that it is only by radically and fundamentally reforming our education
    system and learning the lessons of the highest performing nations that we can
    generate the long-term economic growth on which prosperity depends and that we
    can produce the level of social justice that is appropriate for a modern liberal
    democracy. I hope that across the House tonight we can develop consensus on the
    need for fundamental reform.</p><p pid="b.164.2/5">It was striking that just five
    years ago across the Dispatch Boxes in the House there was consensus between those
    on the two Front Benches on the fundamental need for education reform. My right
    hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40665" name="David
    Cameron">the Member for Witney (Mr Cameron)</phrase> and the then right hon. Member
    for Sedgefield both recognised the fundamental need for reform. I hope that we
    can see the same consensus across the Front Benches tonight. If not, that will
    tell us something about the state of the Labour party in the second decade of
    the 21st century.</p><p pid="b.164.2/6">What about the state of the economy that
    the Labour party bequeathed the coalition Government-the state of the mess that
    we have to clear up? It is against that backdrop that we need to appreciate the
    fundamental need for educational reform. It is only by having a well-educated,
    capable and highly skilled work force that we can deal with the economic crisis
    generated by the right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on the Opposition Front Bench.
    We had a structural deficit for seven years before the banking crisis began. When
    we entered that period of unprecedented global turbulence, our economy had been
    undermined by the actions of the previous Government. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i>
    ]</i> I know that Opposition Members find that difficult and that it is painful
    to be reminded of the desperate position in which they left the country, but the
    need for urgent reform is underlined by the terrible mess they made-<i> [</i><i>
    Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> No matter how much they chunter, object or interject
    from a sedentary position, these are truths that they and the country have to
    face. They cannot run away from that fact.</p><p pid="b.164.2/7">When the OECD
    graded this country in 2000, we had the best fiscal position in the G7, but in
    2007 we had the worst fiscal position, and that was before the banking crisis.
    By 2010, we had the largest deficit of any G20 country, and today we are paying
    &#163;120 million a day in debt interest. Manufacturing output fell by 9% as a
    share of the economy in Labour's years and we lost 1.7 million manufacturing jobs.
    According to the World Economic Forum's ranking of global competitiveness, we
    moved from fourth to 86th. No country can succeed economically or respond to an
    economic crisis unless it ensures that its education system is fit for purpose,
    and under the previous Government it was not.</p>

    It aims to address the concerns articulated by the Royal British Legion and other
    service charities, and to set out in law the definition of the covenant so that
    there can be a legal basis for the principles that the Government must uphold
    in order to provide the forces community with the highest level of care and support.

    Forces Bill Committee that would have fulfilled the aims of today's motion.</p>

    whilst affirming its belief in the principle of simplifying the benefits system
    and good work incentives, declines to give a Second Reading to the Welfare Reform
    Bill because the proposal of the Universal Credit as it stands creates uncertainty
    for thousands of people in the United Kingdom; because the Bill fails to clarify
    what level of childcare support will be available for parents following the abolition
    of the tax credit system; because the Bill penalises savers who will be barred
    from the Universal Credit; because the Bill disadvantages people suffering from
    cancer or mental illness due to the withdrawal of contributory Employment Support
    Allowance; because the Bill contains no safeguards to mothers in receipt of childcare
    support; because it proposes to withdraw the mobility component of Disability
    Living Allowance from people in residential care and fails to provide sufficient
    safeguards for future and necessary reform; because it provides no safeguards
    for those losing Housing Benefit or appropriate checks on the Secretary of State&#8217;s
    powers; because it fails to clarify how Council Tax Benefit will be incorporated
    in the Universal Credit system; because it fails to determine how recipients of
    free school meals and beneficiaries of Social Fund loans will be treated; and
    because the proposals act as a disincentive for the self-employed who wish to
    start up a business; and is strongly of the opinion that the publication of such
    a Bill should have been preceded by both fuller consultation and pre-legislative
    scrutiny of a draft Bill.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.934.1/3">I start with a word of
    thanks to the Secretary of State for meeting me and my right hon. Friend <phrase

    Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase> a week or so ago to discuss the Bill.
    As I said to him then, we genuinely want to approach the vital question of welfare
    reform in a spirit of national consensus. We believe that if we can forge such
    a consensus it will be good for our country, it will reduce the deficit and, crucially,
    as he said before he sat down, it will be good for the fight against poverty in
    this country. We have been forced to table the amendment to oppose the Bill because
    it fails such fundamental tests that we believe the Government should go away
    and bring back a better Bill that will deliver genuine and lasting welfare reform.</p><p
    pid="b.934.1/4">We could begin to forge that national consensus by drawing the
    right lessons from the past 13 years. The Secretary of State presented his view,
    but elided one or two prominent features of the past 13 years, such as the fact
    that the number of people on out-of-work benefits before the depression came down
    by 1 million and the fact that the claimant count halved. We did not once, let
    alone twice, see unemployment go through the 3 million mark. We can draw important
    lessons for this debate from that period, the first of which is that if the Secretary
    of State wants welfare to work to work, we need more jobs. Labour consistently
    put that approach in place.</p><p pid="b.934.1/5">The Secretary of State said

    too often, in a permanent state of worklessness and dependency. For the sake of
    the House, I will go through the relevant clauses of the Bill. I am sure that

    recognise that we shall get to most of the clauses that they want to discuss,
    but I will take interventions as and when they come.</p><p pid="b.919.3/3">The
    problem is that although from 1992 to 2008 this country saw some 63 consecutive
    quarters of growth, and 4 million more people were in employment by the end of
    that period, before the recession had even started we still had some 4 million-plus
    people on out-of-work benefits. The question is: where did all those jobs go?
    Under the previous Government, over half of the jobs created went to foreign nationals.
    This is not an immigration point; it is a point about supply and demand. There
    were a group of people in this country completely unable, it appears, to take
    advantage of that long period of growth and job creation. In essence, the key
    point about the Welfare Reform Bill is that it is intended to help that group.</p>'

    discussing new clause 10, which stands in my name and the names of my hon. Friends,
    I wish to present just a few simple questions to the Committee.</p><p pid="b.233.2/3">What
    accountability do Crown Estate commissioners have to Scotland? The head office
    of the commissioners is here in London, the revenues for the Crown Estate are
    paid here in London, and the commissioners are not obligated to report to the
    Scots Parliament, which is the most democratic forum representing Scotland&#8212;instead,
    they sparingly report to this Parliament. The Crown Estate commissioners in Scotland
    operate under Scots law, because areas over which they take so much control, such
    as the foreshore and sea bed, are governed by Scots law. My argument is that the
    administration of the Crown Estate in Scotland should be constituted and controlled
    within Scots law and the Scottish Parliament.</p><p pid="b.233.2/4">Scotland accounts
    for 6% of the Crown Estate&#8217;s moneys. Two years ago, that was &#163;17 million,
    and last year it was &#163;13 million. People to whom I have spoken consider the
    way in which the Crown Estate commissioners operate in Scotland to be parasitic.
    Other than demanding money, the commissioners are felt not to conduct themselves
    with much positive impact. In fact, they are found to be quite menacing. Year
    after year around the nation&#8217;s coast, they leech their danegeld from harbours,
    ports, moorings industries and some of the most fragile parts of the Scottish
    economy. In Stornoway alone, they take &#163;17,000 from the port authority, whose
    tie I am wearing tonight. It is a galling circumstance in an island community
    to lose a greater part of a person&#8217;s wage to the commissioners, when they
    plough no profits into the harbour or investment, unlike the port authority. The
    port authority is dealing with a landlord&#8212;or a landlord agent&#8212;with
    no obligations at all. In addition, last year, for no visible return, &#163;2.3
    million vanished from the salmon farm industry in Scotland, which must compete
    with the sharp and capable Norwegians, among others.</p><p pid="b.233.2/5">The
    commissioners sold portions of their urban portfolio from Edinburgh&#8217;s lucrative
    Princes street for an &#163;8 million loss to fund shopping centres and warehouses
    in England. We have been told time and again by successive UK Governments that
    Scotland is not getting short-changed</p><p pid="b.233.2/6">from the Crown Estate.
    The commissioners say that they are the best managers of the land, but from what
    I have seen and from what people have told me, with respect, I must disagree.</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/7">The Crown Estate commission is a large management organisation,
    the sole purpose of which, according to the Crown Estate Act 1961, is to &#8220;maintain
    and enhance&#8221; the value of the Crown Estate</p><p pid="b.233.2/8">&#8220;and
    the return obtained from it, but with due regard to the requirements of good management.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/9">How can that organisation manage its land effectively for the
    people of Scotland when it need not report to the Scottish Government or Parliament,
    or indeed to Scottish local authorities?</p><p pid="b.233.2/10">Comhairle nan
    Eilean Siar, the local council in the Outer Hebrides, recently produced a paper
    on renewable energy that in fact turned out in large part to be about the limitations
    to development and the problems that the Crown Estate commissioners pose. It states:</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/11">&#8220;The current Crown Estate lease model is outdated, unfair
    and discriminatory and this inequality will be compounded as the industry grows&#8230;It

    The people of the Outer Hebrides</p><p pid="b.233.2/15">&#8220;view their seas
    as they do their land&#8230;as a resource for the local community. Where possible,
    lease income from marine projects should follow the onshore wind model and remain
    in the&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/16">Outer Hebrides.</p><p pid="b.233.2/17">&#8220;The
    islands of Scotland should&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/18">be permitted to</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/19">&#8220;play a more active part in management of their coastal
    waters and should take a corresponding benefit from the resources present in these
    waters.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/20">The opinion of the Comhairle is that the
    advent of devolution has had a detrimental impact on the Crown Estate, which has
    unfortunately moved</p><p pid="b.233.2/21">&#8220;further away from Scottish sea-based
    communities and lessened&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/22">its</p><p pid="b.233.2/23">&#8220;accountability
    in Scotland. Crown Estate administration and revenues of Scottish territorial
    waters should operate as part of the Scottish Government&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/24">in
    partnership with the appropriate local authority. The Comhairle states:</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/25">&#8220;Management of the local foreshore should transfer to the&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/26">appropriate</p><p pid="b.233.2/27">&#8220;Local Authority&#8230;The
    Crown Estate lease process is rigid and inflexible, incapable of responding to
    fast moving developments in the marine energy sector&#8230;a more responsive process&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/28">is required to</p><p pid="b.233.2/29">&#8220;accommodate speculative
    marine deployments outwith the terms of current or proposed lease bidding rounds.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/30">That is fairly damning.</p><p pid="b.233.2/31">I understand that
    the Crown Estate commissioners offer annual reports to the Houses of Parliament
    under a compulsory legislative duty and do so to the Scots Parliament out of courtesy.
    Although this Parliament can hold the Crown Estate to account via the Chancellor
    of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland&#8212;in my opinion,
    it is not much of an account&#8212;the Scots Parliament holds no such right.</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/32">Let us look back at the genesis of all this. Robin Callander&#8217;s
    book, &#8220;How Scotland is Owned&#8221;, outlines the situation along these
    lines: although Scotland lost its independence in 1707&#8212;temporarily, I hope&#8212;it
    continues to be a sovereign nation and a stateless nation. In Scotland, sovereignty
    rests with the people, not in the persona of the monarch, as is the case in England.
    That is why we have had the King or Queen of Scots as opposed to the King or Queen
    of England. The Crown identity in Scotland is as a representative of the sovereignty
    of the people, hence the traditional phrase &#8220;the community of the realm&#8221;.
    That difference was again seen in the 1680s with the 1688 Bill of Rights in England,
    but the 1689 Claim of Right in Scotland.</p><p pid="b.233.2/33">As illustrated
    by the Comhairle&#8217;s statement, many Scotsmen and women of either an historical
    bent or, as in my case, Hebridean conditioning view the seas as a continuation
    of the land. It is perverse that the most democratic forum representing the sovereign
    Scottish people&#8212;the Scottish Parliament&#8212;does not have control over
    the estates of the people&#8217;s representative. In many cases, the Crown&#8217;s
    rights date back to the 13th and 14th centuries, and some of these are distinctively
    Scottish Crown rights with no legal equivalent in the rest of the UK. The Forestry
    Commission in Scotland used to act on similar lines to the Crown Estate, but its
    powers have now been devolved to allow it to function as an instrument of Scottish
    Government policy, which is what we need the Crown Estate to do at the level of
    local authorities.</p><p pid="b.233.2/34">The Crown Estate commission is a property
    management company that aims not at the public good but unfortunately at the maximum
    extraction of revenue, as I have seen and previously mentioned. The commission
    merely administers property rights and interests that comprise the Crown Estate;
    it does not own the estate. In many cases, it deals with Scottish public land
    with Crown property rights, which is certainly feudal behaviour. A report by the
    Crown Estate working group in 2006 stated that there is a stark contrast between</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/35">&#8220;the ways in which the public interest in the Crown&#8217;s
    ownership of the seabed and public foreshore could be managed to complement Scottish
    Executive&#8217;s policies designed to support rural, coastal and island communities
    and the public interest more generally.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/36">That group
    was composed of The Highland council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Orkney
    Islands council, Shetland Islands council, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Argyll and
    Bute council, Moray council and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities.</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/37">The group concluded&#8212;this is a lengthy but worthwhile quote&#8212;that
    the</p><p pid="b.233.2/38">&#8220;administration and revenues of some of the property
    rights of the Crown in Scotland are already devolved to the Scottish Executive.
    Others which are still managed by the CEC as part of the Crown Estate in Scotland
    could follow, for example, through the planned UK Marine Bill. In considering
    the case for a review, some of the lesser property rights of the Crown in Scotland
    might be seen as historical anachronisms where reform will bring only modest benefits.
    However, reforming the management of Scotland&#8217;s seabed and public foreshore
    offers an opportunity to secure benefits on what might be considered an historic
    scale to Scotland&#8217;s coastal and island communities and the nation as a whole.
    The reform of these property rights of the Crown in Scotland could be as symbolic
    for Scotland as the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s abolition of other property rights
    of the Crown in Scotland with feudal reform. The potential benefits for Scotland
    in this case, however, would be much more tangible and substantial.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/39">We have a serious problem when one of the largest land managers
    in Scotland is not accountable to the people of Scotland. The Crown Estate commissioners
    have a major impact on salmon farming, shellfish farming and aquaculture, they
    derive income from harbours and moorings and they own the entire foreshore around
    Scotland, yet they have absolutely no legislative duty to speak to the Scottish
    Parliament. A group with that much power should be accountable to the local communities
    of Scotland, not the Chancellor of the Exchequer at No. 11 Downing street, which
    is many miles away.</p><p pid="b.233.2/40">Our new clause calls on the Crown Estate
    commissioners to do what they should be doing anyway. We are seeking that the
    Crown Estate revenues be devolved to Scotland and that the management of the estate
    come under the power of the Scots Government. We want the Crown estate to become
    another Scottish success story, like the NHS and the police, and we want to amend
    the 1961 Act with new clause 10. We hope to remove the restrictions in the Scotland
    Act 1998 that prevent the Scottish Government&#8212;and by extension the nation,
    the businesses and the communities, including the islands and coastal communities,
    of Scotland&#8212;from running and directly benefiting from the organisation.
    It is at best odd that this particular function of the Crown was not devolved
    immediately, given that Scotland has more than 60% of the UK&#8217;s coastline.
    The Government&#8217;s plan for a Crown Estate commissioner do not go far enough,
    because this person will be accountable to the Treasury, not Scotland&#8212;more
    like a colonial administrator perhaps. The Crown Estate commissioners should operate
    as a body under Scots law, which is best accomplished by devolving their powers
    to the Scots Parliament and further to local authorities.</p><p pid="b.233.2/41">Before
    the Committee commences its usual assault on the ability of Scots to govern more
    than Westminster wants, I want to draw attention to five Liberal Democrat MPs
    who supported a private Member&#8217;s Bill on the subject in 2006, including
    the hon. Members for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid) and for Caithness, Sutherland and
    Easter Ross (John Thurso), the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40506" name="Charles Kennedy">the right hon. Member
    for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr Kennedy)</phrase>&#8212;I am sure that they will
    not have changed their views in the meantime and that government has not softened
    their strongly held beliefs. In support of the private Member&#8217;s Bill, <phrase
    class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40469" name="Alistair Carmichael">the
    right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)</phrase> said:</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/42">&#8220;The notion that somebody other than the local community
    should own the seabed, particularly around our islands, and make money out of
    it for the Treasury, is quite offensive&#8230; The Crown Estate derives significant
    income from owning something the communities have an absolute need for in terms
    of piers and harbours, cables, fish farms and now the prospect of offshore windfarms.
    These are things we can&#8217;t do without.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/43">In November
    2010, the Liberal Democrat MSP for Orkney said:</p><p pid="b.233.2/44">&#8220;The
    Scotland Bill provides an opportunity to help coast communities and our aquaculture
    and marine renewable energy industries. The UK Government should review the Crown
    Estate&#8217;s role in Scotland and look at using the Bill to devolve powers and
    controls over the seabed.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.233.2/45">Even a senior Liberal
    Democrat Whip spoke up when he called on the Secretary of State for Scotland to
    direct the Crown Estate commissioners to relinquish their</p><p pid="b.233.2/46">control
    of the Scottish seabed to local communities in Scotland. I hope that those words
    will be followed up with action tonight.</p><p pid="b.233.2/47">As the land reformer
    Andy Wightman has said:</p><p pid="b.233.2/48">&#8220;We thus now have a position
    where the Scottish Government supports the return of the administration and revenues
    of the Crown Estate to Scotland. It is joined by many others including the former
    Labour Minister of State at the Scotland Office, Brian Wilson, Highland Council,
    Professor James Hunter CBE, Orkney Islands Council, Lesley Riddoch&#8221;&#8212;</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/49">the broadcaster&#8212;</p><p pid="b.233.2/50">&#8220;the Scottish
    Islands Federation, Local People Leading&#8230;and Reform Scotland&#8221;.</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/51">In 2010, The Highland Council said of this clause:</p><p pid="b.233.2/52">&#8220;The
    Highland Council is firmly of the view that Clause 18 of the Scotland Bill does
    not go far enough. The Council believes that the only way to ensure improved accountability
    and that direct benefits are delivered to Scottish communities is through fully
    devolving the management, administration and revenues of the Crown Estate in Scotland
    to Scottish Ministers in the first instance. Given the new management, regulation
    and planning roles of Marine Scotland, the case for full devolution is even stronger.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.233.2/53">Crown Estate lands in Scotland are best managed by the Scots
    Government. Holyrood&#8217;s sole purpose is to look out for the best interests
    of Scotland. By definition, the UK Parliament must have a different perspective.
    So far, that has meant cutting coastguards and the armed forces in Scotland and
    increasing fuel taxes. A Crown Estate that is only accountable to this place is
    bound to act by that same logic. If the Government truly intend to make the Bill
    the greatest act of devolution for 300 years, the Scots Government, of whichever
    party, should entirely run the Crown Estate lands in Scotland. Anything else is
    utterly unacceptable.</p>'

    pid="b.249.2/3">My ongoing dispute with the assignation of time in the UK is firmly
    on record, with three speeches in <i>Hansard</i> over the past few years. It is
    my intention with the new clause to put an end to my shouting at the sun that
    happens periodically in this place. The new clause has more to do with how we
    deal with the amount of sunlight that we have in Scotland and how that relates
    to time. It deals with any changes to the clocks in the UK.</p><p pid="b.249.2/4">As
    anyone north of Manchester knows, the northern part of the island known as Great
    Britain and the islands to the west and the north of Great Britain are subject
    to very odd sunlight patterns at times, owing to our longitude and latitude and
    the alignment of our islands. We have very different periods of daylight in the
    UK, both summer and winter. Our winter days are short, with sunrise not happening
    till 9 am, so we must be able to adjust our clocks for the best use of time. Over
    the past few centuries, politicians have been bringing forward proposals to address
    the issue, with the most recent proposal occurring in this Parliament as a private
    Member&#8217;s Bill, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40153"
    name="Rebecca Harris">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Rebecca Harris)</phrase>
    demonstrated that there is still a drive to change the clocks unilaterally.</p><p
    pid="b.249.2/5">At present, 65% of Scots are against changing the clocks, according
    to a YouGov survey in February 2010. However, if fewer than 300 MPs at Westminster
    voted to change the clocks in the UK, those MPs would</p><p pid="b.249.2/6">change
    the lives of millions. The Government can make these changes and the Scots Parliament
    has no redress. It has been and will continue to be argued that it will be impossible
    for someone in Scotland to call someone in England because of the time difference,
    which is bunkum, or that it will not be possible to take a train, because it is
    beyond the capability of the human mind for someone to adjust their watch by an
    hour&#8212;again, bunkum. I have faith that everyone can adapt to the slightest
    change.</p>

    hesitate to introduce an element of gravity to the proceedings, given some of
    the entertainment that has featured so far. Over the past few hours, however,
    there has been much debate on issues that did not feature in the Calman report.
    This issue was dealt with in the report, but it does not feature in the Bill.
    It featured in the previous Government&#8217;s White Paper and is referred to
    in the Command Paper that accompanies the Bill, but it is one of the issues that
    appear to have fallen off the edge of the Calman process.</p><p pid="b.264.4/3">During
    this Committee stage the Government have produced explanations, some convincing
    and others less so, for the fact that they are not implementing some of Calman&#8217;s
    recommendations. Part of the purpose of the new clause is to give them an opportunity
    to explain why they are not implementing one particular recommendation. I note
    that the Scottish Parliament legislative consent memorandum Committee, in one
    of its conclusions, suggested that the Government provide a fuller explanation.
    As I am sure that its members read the Command Paper before reaching that conclusion,
    I suspect that merely repeating the terms of the Command Paper will not serve
    to provide the explanation sought by the Committee.</p>

    in decision-making and enables healthcare providers to innovate, improves transparency
    and accountability, is more efficient and gives citizens greater say; recognises

    all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under
    threat of attack in Libya and to enforce the No Fly Zone, including the use of

    Libya. The first British cruise missiles were fired from HMS Triumph at 7 pm.
    Subsequently, RAF Tornados were deployed in several missions. This marked the

    and others at the request of Arab nations to enforce the will of the United Nations.</p><p
    pid="b.700.2/4">In line with UN resolution 1973, there were two aims to these
    strikes. The first was to suppress the Libyan air defences and make possible the
    safe enforcement of a no-fly zone. The second was to protect civilians from attack
    by the Gaddafi regime. Good progress has been made on both fronts. I can announce
    to the House today that coalition forces have largely neutralised Libyan air defences
    and that, as a result, a no-fly zone has effectively been put in place over Libya.
    It is also clear that coalition forces have helped to avert what could have been
    a bloody massacre in Benghazi. In my view, they did so just in the nick of time.</p><p

    set out by UN Security Council resolution 1973.</p><p pid="b.700.2/9">First, we
    said that a ceasefire had to be implemented immediately, and that all attacks
    against civilians must stop. Secondly, we said that Gaddafi had to stop his troops
    advancing on Benghazi. Thirdly, we said that Gaddafi had to pull his forces back
    from Ajdabiya, Misrata and Zawiyah. He had to establish water, electricity and
    gas supplies to all areas, and he had to allow humanitarian assistance to reach
    the people of Libya.</p><p pid="b.700.2/10">The removal of Gaddafi&#8217;s forces
    from those towns would safeguard civilians, enable the aid agencies to operate
    there safely and guarantee the humanitarian assistance that the UN resolution

    conditions are entirely consistent with implementing the UN resolution.</p><p
    pid="b.700.2/11">Gaddafi responded to the United Nations resolution by declaring
    a ceasefire, but straight away it was clear that he was breaking that promise.
    He continued to push his tanks towards Benghazi as quickly as possible, and to
    escalate his actions against Misrata. On Saturday alone, there were reports of
    dozens of people killed in Benghazi and dozens more in Misrata. Gaddafi lied to
    the international community, he continued to brutalise his own people and he was
    in flagrant breach of the UN resolution, so it was necessary, legal and right
    that he should be stopped, and that we should help stop him.</p>'

    national crisis in the form of less growth and jobs than we need&#8217; this Bill
    does not address it; because the economic approach set out by the Government in
    this Bill puts jobs and growth at risk; because the Bill cuts capital allowances
    to businesses who invest in growth;</p><p pid="d.76.4/3">because the Office of
    Budget Responsibility estimates that after all the measures in the Bill are taken
    into account the number of unemployed will be higher by up to 200,000 than forecast
    in November 2010; because the Bill fails to reverse the higher petrol prices faced
    by families as a result of the Government&#8217;s VAT increase in January 2011;
    because it does not address the damage done to family living standards caused
    by the wider tax and benefit changes this month; and because without a repeat
    of the bank bonus tax, the bank levy alone will mean lower taxes for the banks
    at a time when families and children are bearing the brunt of the Government&#8217;s
    cuts to household incomes.&#8221;</p><p pid="d.76.4/4">At the beginning of the
    Second Reading debate on a Finance Bill, it is appropriate to take stock of the
    situation that we face in the UK and of the Government&#8217;s handling of our
    economy almost a year into their time in office. This was the self-styled &#8220;Budget
    for Growth&#8221; that downgraded the growth figures. When one in five young people
    were out of work, it was a Budget that forecast higher levels of unemployment.
    This was a Budget from the deficit cutters which forecast &#163;46 billion of
    higher Government borrowing.</p><p pid="d.76.4/5">After listening for months to
    his analysis of the economic challenges facing this country, I must confess that
    I am very worried about the credibility of the Chancellor. His explanation of
    the origins of the banking crisis and the recession that it caused is partisan
    fiction&#8212;it has very little connection to economic reality. It seems that
    I am not alone in worrying about his grasp of the facts, because over the weekend
    he has been attacked by the enemy within. He has been accused of &#8220;fiddling
    the figures&#8221; and telling &#8220;untruths&#8221;, threatened with a lawsuit
    and told to withdraw &#8220;completely unfounded&#8221; claims or risk losing
    &#8220;his credibility as Chancellor&#8221;&#8212;that is just what the Energy
    Secretary is saying about him.</p><p pid="d.76.4/6">The Chancellor is clearly
    also a founder member of the enemy faction identified by the Deputy Prime Minister
    in his interview with <i>The Independent</i> over the weekend as</p><p pid="d.76.4/7">&#8220;a
    right-wing elite, a right-wing clique who want to keep things the way they are&#8221;.</p><p
    pid="d.76.4/8">Perhaps the Chancellor could tell us, if he bothered to turn up<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]
    </i>Perhaps the &#8220;Orange Book&#8221; Liberals are part of that right-wing
    clique. Perhaps the Chancellor will tell us whether this right-wing clique all
    have a uniform as fetching as the Bullingdon club tux?</p><p pid="d.76.4/9">What
    about the Chancellor&#8217;s deputy, the Chief Secretary? In response to the Chancellor&#8217;s
    wild accusations last week about the funding of the &#8220;Yes to AV&#8221; campaign,
    the Chief Secretary said:</p><p pid="d.76.4/10">&#8220;I think it is a real shame
    that this sort of pretty desperate scaremongering is going on.&#8221;</p><p pid="d.76.4/11">Well
    let me tell the Chief Secretary that I know just how he feels, because the Chancellor
    has been indulging in pretty desperate scaremongering about the threat of a UK
    sovereign debt crisis since his theatrically named &#8220;Emergency Budget&#8221;
    last June, and he has been aided and abetted by none other than the Chief Secretary.
    As the Energy Secretary said in his letter to the Chancellor over the weekend:</p><p
    pid="d.76.4/12">&#8220;Robust debate is normal in British politics. Persistent
    resort to falsehoods is not.&#8221;</p><p pid="d.76.4/13">So the Energy Secretary
    is off to consult his lawyers, and the Chancellor, the Prime Minister, the Foreign
    Secretary and the chair of the Conservative Party all appear to be in his sights.</p><p
    pid="d.76.4/14">In the meantime, will the Chief Secretary now admit, in the interests
    of not persistently resorting to falsehoods, that the banking crisis and global
    recession were not caused by the previous Prime Minister? The truth is that he
    helped to avoid a global depression and that the current Chancellor got every
    important call in those days of world crisis wrong. Will the Chief Secretary also
    have the decency to admit that the deficit was not caused by too much spending
    on schools and hospitals or by the profligacy of nurses and teachers? The truth
    is that the crisis was caused by unforgivable excess in the banking sector. Will
    he also take this opportunity to disown and stop repeating the Chancellor&#8217;s
    irresponsible and pretty desperate scaremongering about Britain being on the brink
    of a sovereign debt crisis like Greece or Portugal, when it is obvious that it
    is not?</p><p pid="d.76.4/15">Like the Energy Secretary, I believe that robust
    debate is normal in British politics, but persistent resort to falsehoods is not.
    Will the Chief Secretary therefore now disown the &#8220;pretty desperate scaremongering&#8221;&#8212;I
    use his own words&#8212;about the supposed threat of a UK sovereign debt crisis?
    The truth is that it was the banking crisis that had a disastrous impact on the
    public finances. Between 2008 and 2009, nominal GDP fell by 1.8%&#8212;that cost
    &#163;20.6 billion&#8212;and tax receipts dropped by 3.7%, costing &#163;19.9
    billion. Will he acknowledge that this sudden collapse in economic activity is
    responsible for the bulk of the deficit? This is not a deficit caused by too much
    public spending before the crisis, but a deficit caused by the crisis. The truth
    is that the deficit is the price that we are paying for the failure of the banking
    system and the recession that was caused by that failure. It is also the price
    that we paid to prevent a global recession from turning into a worldwide depression,
    and it was essential to our future well-being as a nation that a depression was
    averted. We could all have a more mature and relevant debate in this House about
    the formidable economic challenges facing us, if we began with an acknowledgement
    of the truth of these facts.</p><p pid="d.76.4/16">Last June, in their first Budget,
    this Government embarked on a risky and dangerous experiment with the future of
    our economy. Last year, they abandoned Labour&#8217;s plans to halve the deficit
    in four years and decided to plough full steam ahead with a deficit reduction
    plan that went further and faster than that of any other major economy in the
    G20. So preoccupied were they with their desire to make the biggest public spending
    cuts since the second world war that they also failed to ensure that growth formed
    a key part of deficit reduction. They opted for a high-risk approach, and this
    Finance Bill continues that dubious experiment.</p><p pid="d.76.4/17">It appears
    that the Government are in thrall to the economic dogma of a long-dead 19th-century
    economist, David Ricardo, and their ideological preference for a small state.
    They imagine that the smaller the government, the less taxation and spending there
    will be. They think that the private sector will somehow automatically fill the
    gap left by cuts and that the economy will just grow. That is why they have embarked
    on a drastic programme of deep and immediate cuts that, if their theory is correct,
    should already be turning the economy around by now and why they are so uncomfortable
    with publishing their wholly inadequate self-styled, &#8220;Plan for Growth&#8221;,
    which was meant to be the public relations centrepiece of the Budget. Their laissez-faire
    economic approach assumes that growth will happen automatically without</p><p
    pid="d.76.4/18">the need for any Government support, much less a plan. That is
    why the plan was so delayed and of such dubious merit when it finally arrived.
    Keynesians, however, believe that the economy works very differently and that
    the Ricardian equivalence dogma is wrong. We ignore the insights of Keynes at
    our peril, which is why the Government&#8217;s economic policy, as set out in
    the Bill, is taking us in the wrong direction.</p><p pid="d.76.4/19">The great
    banking crisis of 2007, which began in the American sub-prime mortgage market,
    administered a huge and near-fatal shock to the world&#8217;s financial system.</p>

    clauses that we are here to debate are another important step on the long road
    to economic recovery. They will promote growth and provide support for households
    and small businesses under pressure. They will encourage investment as well as
    enterprise, and they will help us to clean up the mess that the previous Government
    left behind.</p><p pid="d.68.3/3">As we start this debate, it is worth recalling
    the state of the economy that this Government inherited nearly a year ago. Britain
    had endured the longest and deepest recession in living memory. We were borrowing
    one pound for every four we were spending. We had the largest budget deficit in
    our peacetime history, one of the largest in Europe and the largest in the G20,
    yet no detailed plan was in place to deal with it&#8212;and that was not the end
    of the story. In the preceding decade Britain had slipped down the international
    league of competitiveness from fourth to 12th. We had seen our share of world
    exports decline, and we were considered to be a worse place to start a business
    than many of our European neighbours.</p><p pid="d.68.3/4">That was the coalition
    Government&#8217;s inheritance, which is why we have set about restoring confidence
    and stability to our economy, with a clear strategy for growth. At its heart is
    a credible plan to tackle the enormous deficit&#8212;a plan we are already implementing&#8212;so
    that the current structural deficit will fall in each and every year of this Parliament,
    and is forecast to be eliminated by 2015. National debt is forecast to fall as
    a proportion of gross domestic product in the same year, so that we can finally
    start to reduce the huge interest payments with which this country has been saddled&#8212;the
    lasting legacy of Labour&#8217;s failure.</p><p pid="d.68.3/5">The action we have
    taken on the deficit has shown that Britain&#8217;s economic future is now in
    safe hands, that this is a Government who know how to manage the country&#8217;s
    finances and that we have a credible plan to deliver the strong, sustainable and
    rebalanced growth that this country needs.</p>

    which have got in the way of patient care, to use the present pause in the progress

    last month. He was forced to do so because of the growing criticism, confusion
    and crisis of confidence over the Government&#8217;s NHS reorganisation. It was
    unprecedented because he told his Health Secretary to stop what he was doing while
    45 others on the NHS Future Forum work out what he should be doing. It looks as
    though the Prime Minister is listening to anybody and everybody on the NHS except
    the Health Secretary.</p><p pid="c.912.2/4">We have called this debate after the

    and Social Care Bill are his new No. 1 priority. The Deputy Prime Minister and
    his party are up to their necks in the Tory NHS plans. He and the Prime Minister
    co-signed the foreword to the White Paper last summer, and he signed off the NHS
    legislation in Cabinet before Christmas. He and his Lib Dem MPs have backed the
    Bill at every stage in Parliament. In Committee, his Lib Dem Health Minister led
    the rejection of Labour&#8217;s amendments&#8212;the amendments that he now says
    he wants to make.</p><p pid="c.912.2/5">Now that the Lib Dems are making many

    what the Deputy Prime Minister has been doing for the past year, when he changed
    his mind and why. People may suspect that the deal he is stitching together has
    more to do with saving his party than safeguarding the NHS.</p>

    me begin by thanking all Members on both sides of the House who served on the
    Bill Committee. As with all the best Bill Committees, it was always good-humoured
    and good-natured, and it included thorough scrutiny of each of the Bill&#8217;s
    79 clauses and 17 or 18 schedules. In barely a month we had 22 sittings, even
    more than the Committee considering the mammoth Bill that became the last Government&#8217;s
    Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act 2009, which, with 270 clauses,
    was well over three times the size. We also reached the final clause with time
    left over to debate new clauses as well, which is rare for any Bill Committee.
    It is therefore only right and proper for me to pay tribute to the Minister for
    Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, as well to officials in the two
    Departments and officials of the House.</p><p pid="d.1268.3/3">Having spent 13
    years in opposition, I know from first-hand experience how demanding a Committee
    stage can be for Opposition spokesmen, so let me also thank</p><p pid="d.1268.3/4">the
    hon. Members for Hartlepool (Mr Wright) and for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan) for
    the professional way in which they fulfilled their responsibilities.</p><p pid="d.1268.3/5">The
    Education Bill has four principal aims: to help schools improve behaviour in the
    classroom, to remove bureaucratic burdens from schools and, in particular, from
    teachers by restoring trust in professionals, to ensure that schools are properly
    accountable to parents and local communities for what they do, and to ensure that
    the resources that we have are distributed fairly and targeted towards those pupils
    that need them the most.</p>'

    The level of interest in the Bill across the House and during the 80 hours of
    scrutiny that it has received so far is testament to its importance and significance
    in the future of our national life. As well as paying tribute to members of the
    Committee, who laboured long in the Committee Room upstairs, I thank in particular
    my ministerial colleagues for all their hard work in preparing and speaking to
    the Bill, as well as the Whips of both parties who kept us in order and made sure
    that we considered every clause without needing to curtail our deliberations.
    I thank my parliamentary private secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40311"
    name="John Howell">the hon. Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase>, whose seminal
    paper, &#8220;Open Source Planning&#8221;, was the source of inspiration for many
    of the policies in the Bill. I pay tribute to all my officials and to Officers

    his experience of introducing the measures we then went on to repeal. The fact
    that he mostly kept his composure during that time, I think we acknowledged. He
    had a flair for simile, we noted, comparing Ministers and the Secretary of State
    to everyone from Draco to Henry VIII to Dr Pangloss</p><p pid="c.455.0/6">and
    everyone in between. A phrase that might have gained his approval is one that

    of local government and community leadership from both sides of the Committee.
    It would be invidious for me to single out individual members, but the representation
    on the Committee of people with long experience of local government and civic
    and community leadership marked the Committee out as having been selected particularly
    appropriately and well. The Chamber tends to produce more partisanship than is
    often the case in Committee or below the surface. Of course we have had our disagreements
    during the past two years, but I do feel that we were able to make substantial
    progress with the Bill in Committee. It is a landmark Bill.</p>

    class="" pid="b.703.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House opposes the Government&#8217;s
    cuts leading to over 12,000 fewer police officers across England and Wales; believes
    that the 20 per cent. cut to central Government funding to the police goes far
    beyond the assessment of HM Inspectorate of Constabulary of efficiency savings
    that are possible without affecting frontline services; calls on the Government
    to withdraw plans for American-style police and crime commissioners for which
    there will be no checks or balances; and believes that the Government is making
    it harder for the police to cut crime by weakening the National DNA Database,
    leading to the loss of 1,000 criminal matches per year; ending anti-social behaviour
    orders, increasing bureaucracy on CCTV, creating serious loopholes in child protection
    and failing to develop any cross-Governmental strategy to cut crime.</p><p pid="b.703.1/3">This
    is our fourth debate on policing and crime on the Floor of the House in the past
    four months. Time and again we have warned the Home Secretary that she is stirring
    up a perfect storm on crime. Time and again we have warned the Prime Minister
    that he is making the wrong decisions on law and order, and they are still not
    listening. The Home Secretary is not listening to the warning words from chief
    constables across the country. She is not listening to the cries from communities
    such as All Saints in Wolverhampton, where hundreds of people have signed a petition
    to keep their local bobby on the beat. She is not listening to the public telling
    pollsters and researchers that they do not trust her party on crime. As she showed
    at the police conference last week, she also is not listening to the silence.</p><p
    pid="b.703.1/4">The storm we warned of is building. Cuts to police officer numbers
    are being felt. Front-line services that the Home Secretary promised to protect
    are being hit. There are cuts to youth services and family intervention projects
    that were helping to bring crime down. There is higher youth unemployment and
    poverty is rising. There are cuts to the powers that the police and courts need,
    and chaos in her policing reforms. American-style police and crime commissioners
    were rejected by the House of Lords for putting centuries of impartial British
    policing at risk.</p>

    class="" pid="b.175.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House regrets that the Government&#8217;s
    policies are hitting women and families hardest, including direct tax and benefit
    changes, cuts to childcare support and Sure Start which are making it harder for
    women to work, reductions in domestic and sexual violence specialist support,
    and their impact on the provision of social care; opposes plans that will make
    300,000 women born between December 1953 and October 1954 wait an additional 18
    months or longer to receive their state pension; calls on the Government to maintain
    the commitment given in the Coalition Agreement that the state pension age for
    women will not start to rise to 66 sooner than 2020; believes that promoting equality
    for women is vital to building a fairer society; and calls on the Government to
    commission independent, robust assessments of the impact of its policies on women
    and to prevent the implementation of policies that could widen inequality between
    women and men.</p><p pid="b.175.2/3">I got an e-mail from a woman called Michelle,
    who lives in my constituency. Michelle is a single mother with a toddler; she
    works part-time in a bank to support her family; and she studies part-time at
    the Open university, because she wants to get on and build a better future for
    herself and her child. Right now, she is very worried. Her train fares are going
    up and she is afraid that her course fees will go up, but the really big blow
    for her is that her child tax credit is being cut from 80% to 70%.</p><p pid="b.175.2/4">Michelle
    wrote:</p><p pid="b.175.2/5">&#8220;This is really devastating for me. My nursery
    fees are &#163;530 a month, and my salary is &#163;600 a month. This is an extra
    &#163;50 each month out of my already very tight budget. This sadly is going to
    force me out of work and onto benefits, which I desperately don&#8217;t want to
    do. It is so unfair and I am very angry. I want David Cameron, George Osborne
    and the rest of the coalition to acknowledge this is happening to myself and thousands
    of other single parents, but that will never happen.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.175.2/6">It
    is because of Michelle and the stories that we have heard from so many women throughout
    the country that we have called this debate today. We are deeply worried about
    women who are struggling to work because of the changes that the Government have
    made; women who are finding it harder to make ends meet; women who are losing
    their own income and some of the independence that they value; women who are losing
    thousands of pounds of their pensions; and women such as Michelle who are finding
    it more difficult to work because of the sheer scale of the assault on families
    throughout the country&#8212;20% cuts to the Sure Start budget, cuts to child
    care tax credit and cuts to child tax credit.</p><p pid="b.175.2/7">The Government
    are taking more money from support for children than they are from the banks as
    part of their deficit reduction plan, and mothers throughout the country are taking
    the strain. Time and again, the Government hit women and families hardest, and
    I fear that for the first time in many generations equality and progress for women
    is being rolled back.</p><p pid="b.175.2/8">All Members know and will celebrate
    the major advances that we have seen in women&#8217;s equality over the</p><p
    pid="b.175.2/9">past century. When we celebrated the centenary of international
    women&#8217;s day, I met a woman called Hetty Bower, who is already more than
    100 years old and has received her telegram from the Queen. When Hetty was born,
    however, women did not have the vote, and when she had her first child there was
    no maternity care on the NHS&#8212;indeed, there was no NHS. She worked, but she
    certainly did not get maternity pay, family allowance or child benefit. By the
    time her daughter started work, it was still legal to pay women less than men
    to do the same job, and even when her granddaughter started work there was still
    little child care and little help for women wanting to work part-time or to care
    for their elderly parents.</p><p pid="b.175.2/10">When the Secretary of State
    and I were elected to Parliament, maternity leave was just 14 weeks, compared
    with 52 weeks today, and there were child care places for only one in eight children,
    rather than the one in four today. Of course, here in Westminster itself we had
    no nursery, but we still had a shooting range.</p><p pid="b.175.2/11">All the
    progress that we have seen for women over those years has been hard-won, and we
    should not take it for granted. From the suffragettes to the Dagenham strikers,
    women have campaigned and worked hard for those changes.</p><p pid="b.175.2/12">We
    know that there is still a long way to go, and if we look at the facts we find
    that, even some 40 years after passing the Equal Pay Act 1970, the pay gap remains
    at 15%. Women still make up only 12.5% of the boards of the UK&#8217;s top 100
    companies. One in four women is a victim of domestic violence in their lifetime.
    Women here still represent only 22% of our Parliament. Some 30,000 women lose
    their jobs every year because of pregnancy. So yes, we have come a long way, but
    we have further to travel yet.</p><p pid="b.175.2/13">I think that the Minister
    for Women and Equalities and the Minister for Equalities support progress for
    women and agree that it should go further and faster. The trouble is that their
    Government are not delivering; instead, they are turning back the clock.</p>

  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="b.878.7/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="b.878.7/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    am conscious that we have only half an hour, so I will try to make some progress.
    A great deal has been debated, but I am happy to take a couple of interventions.
    I recognise that some others on the Back Benches would like to say something because
    they did not get in earlier, and I think we ought to leave them some time.</p><p
    pid="b.878.7/3">The Bill allows us to start dealing once and for all with the
    welfare dependency we inherited. Just the other week we learned from the Office
    for National Statistics that there are now nearly twice as many households in
    the UK where no one has ever worked as there were in 1997, and today there are
    nearly 2 million children</p><p pid="b.878.7/4">growing up in workless households&#8212;children
    with no positive role models who can teach them the benefits of work. This entrenched
    worklessness is the issue, and is the product of a broken welfare system that
    takes away up to 96p in every pound earned as people increase their hours in work.
    It is a system that shunts people from employment programme to employment programme,
    never looking at them as individuals but as collective groups. It is a system
    that provides disabled people with outdated and complex support that often fails
    them when they most need it. By the end of Labour&#8217;s term in office, that
    system left us with income inequality at its highest level since records began,
    despite the billions Labour spent. The backdrop to this social breakdown was the
    inheritance of an economy that was absolutely on its knees when we came into government.</p>

    I first say something that might help the House? Hon. Members might not realise
    that there are a number of different things in the Bill, and I plan to go through
    those elements. I will obviously take interventions, and it would be helpful if
    interventions were made on those sections in due course; otherwise, it will take
    a long time, and I know colleagues want to speak.</p><p pid="c.41.1/3">The Bill
    is designed to secure this country&#8217;s retirement system, putting it on a
    stable and sustainable footing for the future. I remind the House that our first
    priority on coming into government was to secure the position of today&#8217;s
    pensioners. We acted immediately to introduce the triple guarantee, meaning that
    someone retiring today on a full basic state pension will receive &#163;15,000
    more over their retirement by way of the basic state pension than they would have
    under the old prices link. For 10 years, the previous Government talked about
    this, but we acted in our first year.</p><p pid="c.41.1/4">The backdrop to the
    Bill is that we have taken action, and we have committed to a permanent increase
    in the cold weather payments to &#163;25&#8212;an increase the previous Government
    had planned to be temporary. The old rate, I remind colleagues, was &#163;8.50.
    Last winter alone we paid out some &#163;430 million to support vulnerable families.

  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="b.192.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="" pid="b.192.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to require the Secretary of State to make provision for the transfer to the
    Welsh Government of certain functions relating to the work of Jobcentre Plus offices
    in Wales; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="b.192.2/3">The Bill&#8217;s aim
    is to devolve responsibility for elements of Jobcentre Plus&#8217;s work in Wales
    to the Welsh Government. I am grateful for the support I have received from Plaid
    Cymru and the Scottish National party, the Alliance party, the Liberal Democrats,
    the Green party and the Labour party.</p><p pid="b.192.2/4">The argument for the
    measure is straightforward. The Welsh Government have responsibility for education
    and training under the Education, Lifelong Learning and Skills portfolio, and
    for the economy under the Business, Enterprise, Technology and Science portfolio.
    They operate a large-scale programme of social inclusion in particularly deprived
    areas, one aim of which is to improve employability. Jobcentre Plus will work
    through the Work programme with large numbers of Welsh people who are looking
    for work, but the responsibility for that activity in Wales lies with the Government
    here. I think that getting unemployed people back to work would be more effective,
    better organised and co-ordinated, and that accountability would be much stronger,
    if that was the Welsh Government&#8217;s responsibility, working closely of course
    with the Government in London.</p><p pid="b.192.2/5">It would be up to the Welsh
    Government to determine how to organise matters, but elements of a possible model
    might be derived from Northern Ireland, where the Department for Employment and
    Learning works to promote learning and skills, to prepare people for work and
    to support the economy. Its objectives are to promote economic, social and personal
    development through high quality learning, research and skills training, and to
    help people into employment. It works with individuals to improve their skills
    and qualifications, with those who need support and guidance to progress their
    employment, including self-employment, and with businesses in the public and private
    sectors.</p><p pid="b.192.2/6">Some of the Department&#8217;s key activities include:
    enhancing the provision of learning and skills, including entrepreneurship, enterprise,
    management and leadership; increasing research and development, creativity and
    innovation; developing and maintaining a framework of employment rights and responsibilities,
    and, crucially, helping individuals acquire jobs, including through self-employment,
    and improving the links between employment programmes and skills development.</p><p
    pid="b.192.2/7">All that offers many elements that we could adopt in Wales to
    tailor a comprehensive employment service, better suited to the needs of our country.
    That need, I am sorry to say, is great.</p><p pid="b.192.2/8">I am glad that unemployment
    in Wales was lower in the last quarter, but it still stands at 115,000 people
    or 7.9%, with the United Kingdom level being 7.7%. The number of jobseeker&#8217;s
    allowance claimants increased in the last quarter by 1,700 to 72,000, and total
    employment was up at 1,349,000.</p><p pid="b.192.2/9">However, the number of economically
    inactive Welsh people stands at 480,000, including many older people, who find
    it particularly difficult to find a job. They represent 25.3% of the working-age
    Welsh population, compared with 23.3% for the UK as a whole. Most tellingly, 77,000
    Welsh people have been without a job for 10 or more years. The need is indeed
    great.</p><p pid="b.192.2/10">My aim in the Bill is therefore to integrate better
    learning, skills and development and job finding, education and social action,
    enterprise and self-employment in Wales, all under the Welsh Government, to fashion
    them into a better organised and more coherent form. That change would help unemployed
    people build on their individual skills and find relevant and worthwhile employment
    that meets their needs and those of society. It would also help to promote Welsh
    business and enterprise, by working with the grain of the system of Welsh government
    in a simplified, one-stop model. Essentially, this is a common-sense matter of
    improving co-ordination and delivery, and of locating the task at the most local
    level where it can be best carried out.</p><p pid="b.192.2/11">I have concerns
    about the current system, and particularly about the Work programme. Currently,
    job seeking is all too often associated negatively in the public mind with claiming
    benefits. That creates a negative and often stigmatising view of the process,
    when it should be part of our wider contract between people and communities. We
    should assist in the provision of work, which allows people to pay taxes and contribute
    to the wider society. There is no reason why that negativity should be so, particularly
    if job seeking is linked with positive activities such as providing education
    and training, and enterprise and development. Job seeking could and should be
    viewed as positively as entrepreneurship is viewed.</p><p pid="b.192.2/12">Jobcentre
    staff do a difficult job in hard circumstances. It was difficult enough running
    the new deal in good times, but now times are very much harder. It is not simple
    or easy to find employment, especially for people who have been out of work for
    a long time and those who face a disability of some sort. We have many such people
    in Wales. People fear that, under the Work programme, some severely disadvantaged
    people will not be helped because there are insufficient funds to meet their more
    complex needs. The task in deprived areas will also be difficult, because there
    will be few job outcomes. People fear that such areas will be sidelined.</p><p
    pid="b.192.2/13">Ministers have said that the Work programme will tackle the endemic
    worklessness that has blighted so many communities for decades, but I fear that
    insufficient account has been taken of the differences between labour markets,
    the different conditions that businesses, especially small businesses, face, and
    the nature of education and training in Wales. In Wales, much of the expertise
    in such matters lies with the Welsh Government.</p><p pid="b.192.2/14">Furthermore,
    in Wales, the voluntary sector and the capacity of organisations to become subcontractors
    in the Work programme varies enormously. I have very competent and successful
    third sector employment organisations in my constituency, such as Agoriad and
    Antur Waunfawr, but in rural Wales in general we have a preponderance of voluntary
    bodies that do not employ professional staff. There must be doubts about the ability
    of some such organisations to participate.</p><p pid="b.192.2/15">Interestingly,
    Neil Lee, a senior economist at the Work Foundation, has pointed out that the</p><p
    pid="b.192.2/16">&#8220;Work programme is based on a national payment structure
    and does not take into account local and regional variations in labour demand&#8230;There
    is the danger that private contractors will focus on investing in places where
    they are more likely to get people into work to secure a return on investment.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.192.2/17">There are many such places in Wales, most notably the Rhondda,
    where I believe there is one job for every 120-odd people seeking it.</p>'

  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="c.326.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="" pid="c.326.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to require the Secretary of State to make provision for a ban on smoking
    in private vehicles where there are children present; and for connected purposes.</p><p
    pid="c.326.2/3">My constituency is ranked 15th in the British Lung Foundation&#8217;s
    ranking of constituencies for children at most risk of passive smoking. The parent
    smoking hot spots table shows that almost 29% of households in Stockton North
    contain parents who smoke. In addition, the number of adult smokers is significantly
    higher than the England average, as are deaths from smoking. Also, more women
    smoke in pregnancy than the national average.</p><p pid="c.326.2/4">We are all
    aware that passive smoking is harmful to children&#8217;s health. According to
    the tobacco advisory group at the Royal College of Physicians, more than 300,000
    children in the UK present to their GP with passive smoking-related illnesses
    every year. It also estimates that passive smoking causes about 20,000 new cases
    of wheezing and asthma in UK children each year, and makes a conservative estimate
    that that costs the NHS &#163;22 million a year in hospital admissions and treatment
    costs.</p><p pid="c.326.2/5">In north-east England we are working hard to address
    the issue, including through action by charities such as Fresh, and we have had
    some great success. Smoking rates in the region dropped from 29% in 2005 to 22%
    in 2009, a welcome step forward in the fight against tobacco. Fresh tells me,
    however, that some 84,000 children in north-east England are still exposed to
    second-hand smoke in the home, a figure that must come down.</p><p pid="c.326.2/6">A
    recent YouGov poll showed that 90% of smokers in the north-east of England worry
    about the impact of smoking around children, and that 78% support a ban on smoking
    in cars carrying children younger than 18. That support is even higher elsewhere.
    When the British Lung Foundation teamed up with Mumsnet to find out the views
    of parents on smoking, it found that more than 85% of them supported a proposed
    ban on smoking where children are present. The research also showed that 83% of
    smoking parents said they would support legislation to protect children.</p><p
    pid="c.326.2/7">The science is clear. Experts say that children are particularly
    vulnerable to passive smoke, as they have quicker breathing rates. It goes without
    saying that consistent exposure to second-hand smoke can lead to a lifetime of
    respiratory problems. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health has shown
    that smoking in cars is dangerous to children even after the cigarette is extinguished.
    Levels of second-hand smoke in cars can be extremely high, because of the restricted
    area in which the smoke is circulated.</p><p pid="c.326.2/8">A study by Aberdeen
    university showed that smoking in a car exposes children to levels of smoke that
    compare with the levels in a smoke-filled pub, which we fortunately no longer
    have to endure. The fact that children can be exposed to such an environment in
    cars is reason enough to introduce a ban on smoking in private vehicles when they
    are present.</p><p pid="c.326.2/9">In the Government&#8217;s tobacco control plan
    for England, &#8220;Healthy Lives, Healthy People&#8221;, they say that they want
    people to recognise the risk of second-hand smoke and to decide to make their
    homes and cars smoke free. Frankly, that is not good enough. We need a ban, and
    healthier children. I am told that the Government&#8217;s marketing strategy for
    tobacco control will set out further details on how they will support efforts
    to encourage smoke-free homes and family cars. Perhaps they will take the right
    action, but they need to be decisive.</p><p pid="c.326.2/10">We already have legislation
    to ban smoking in vehicles carrying passengers in the course of paid or voluntary
    work, including buses, trains, planes and taxis. I remember when it was considered
    normal for people to light up on public transport. Most would agree that attitudes
    have changed significantly. I cannot see how it can be a real hardship to anyone
    to stop smoking in private vehicles. The benefits will be tremendous. Given the
    significant health impact on children, who are unable to remove themselves from
    such cars, the Government should not dismiss calls for a ban.</p><p pid="c.326.2/11">Some
    will say that the car is a private space in which the Government should not intervene,
    but is the space in the back of a car not the child&#8217;s private space? Some
    adults invade it with dangerous smoke&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i>
    They do! They invade it with dangerous smoke. Some have asked why I am not pushing
    for a blanket ban on smoking in private vehicles. I believe that adults can make
    up their own minds about the dangers of smoking. We need to protect children.</p><p
    pid="c.326.2/12">Opinion research by the British Lung Foundation highlights the
    growing consensus among parents and children for legislation to protect children
    from passive smoke while they are travelling in cars. Its petition calling for
    legislation has already been signed by more than 16,000 people. The foundation&#8217;s
    research shows that just over half of eight to 15-year-olds surveyed were exposed
    to cigarette smoke when confined in a car, and that 86% of children in the UK
    want people to stop it. Rather worryingly, almost a quarter of the children surveyed
    reported that they had said nothing when someone smoked in the car, because they
    were too embarrassed. One in 10 said that they were too scared to say anything.</p><p
    pid="c.326.2/13">I would ask those who believe that legislation would be ineffective
    to look at car legislation on seat belts, mobile phones and drink-driving. Most
    if not all people adhere to such laws without the police becoming heavy-handed.
    For example, information provided to me by the House of Commons Library demonstrates
    that when wearing seat belts was made compulsory in 1983, the wearing of seat
    belts increased significantly. Before the law, 40% wore a seat belt, and 90% afterwards.
    A 1985 report estimated that that change saved around 7,000 fatal or serious casualties,
    and 13,000 slight casualties in the first year alone.</p><p pid="c.326.2/14">There
    are precedents from elsewhere for a ban such as the one I propose. Were such a
    ban introduced, we would be joining several countries where smoking in cars carrying
    children is prohibited. In the USA, legislation has been introduced in states
    including California and Maine; in Canada, there is legislation in British Columbia
    and Ontario; and in Australia, Queensland and Tasmania have introduced legislation.</p><p
    pid="c.326.2/15">Professor John Britton from Nottingham City hospital has looked
    at the lessons from Canada, where a national media programme was supported by
    legislation in some provinces. Data provided to him demonstrate that provinces
    that implemented legislation on smoking in cars with children saw a dramatic drop
    in exposure to smoke compared with states that focused only on education. In one
    case, the proportion fell from 21.4% to 13%.</p><p pid="c.326.2/16">UK politicians
    want action too: 36 MPs signed my early-day motion, and 78 signed early-day motion
    214, sponsored by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268"
    name="Ian Mearns">the Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase>, which is on
    a similar issue. In Wales, the chief medical officer, Dr Tony Jewell, announced
    that he wants to start a debate on smoking in cars carrying children, and the
    public health department in Jersey is currently considering whether to ban smoking
    in cars altogether.</p><p pid="c.326.2/17">The health costs can be illustrated
    no better than by someone who has spoken openly and honestly about her smoking.
    Sharon Gould from Leicester told the British Lung Foundation that she started
    smoking when she was 14. Throughout her son Ben&#8217;s childhood she tried to
    give up smoking but did not manage to quit until three years ago. She would occasionally
    smoke in the car when he was present&#8212;always with the window down&#8212;and
    she also smoked in the home. She always thought, &#8220;Just one won&#8217;t hurt.&#8221;
    However, she was not aware of the serious dangers of passive smoking on Ben&#8217;s
    health&#8212;a child who was found to be asthmatic. Sharon is unaware of any family
    history of lung disease, so believes that her son&#8217;s asthma has been caused,
    in part, by passive smoking. She said:</p><p pid="c.326.2/18">&#8220;I don&#8217;t
    know if passive smoke was the whole cause of Ben&#8217;s asthma, but I know that
    it&#8217;s part of it&#8230;. It is vital that all parents understand the dangerous
    effects of passive smoke on developing young lungs.&#8221;</p><p pid="c.326.2/19">I
    have had particular support for the Bill from many members of the all-party group
    on asthma, who I am sure have all heard similar stories to the one told by Sharon.
    I would also like to thank the organisations that have lent their support to this
    cause, including the British Lung Foundation, Action on Smoking and Health, Fresh
    in the north-east and the British Heart Foundation. I am especially pleased to
    have secured support for the Bill from Members on both sides of the House. Polling
    indicates that the public are strongly in favour of a ban, and I hope that all
    Members will seek to protect the health of children in their constituencies. That
    is why I have brought the Bill before the House.</p>'

    class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June 2010</phrase> the Chancellor announced
    his first Budget with a target to eliminate the structural deficit by 2015-16
    through an additional &#163;40 billion of spending cuts and tax rises, including
    a VAT rise; further notes that over the last six months the economy has not grown,
    in the last month retail sales fell by 1.4 per cent. and manufacturing output
    fell by 1.5 per cent. and despite a welcome recent fall in unemployment, the Office
    for Budget Responsibility predicts that future unemployment will be up to 200,000
    higher than expected; believes the Government&#8217;s policies to cut the deficit
    too far and too fast have led to slower growth, higher inflation and higher unemployment,
    which are creating a vicious circle, since the Government is now set to borrow
    &#163;46 billion more than previously forecast; calls on the Government to adopt
    a more balanced deficit plan which, alongside tough decisions on tax and spending
    cuts, puts jobs first and will be a better way to get the deficit down over the
    longer term and avoid long-term damage to the economy; and, if the Government
    will not change course and halve the deficit over four years, demands that it
    should take a step in the right direction by temporarily cutting VAT to 17.5 per
    cent. until the economy returns to strong growth and by using funds raised from
    repeating the 2010 bank bonus tax to build 25,000 affordable homes and create
    100,000 jobs for young people.</p><p pid="c.332.3/3">A year ago today, in his
    first Budget statement to the House, the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a clear
    choice. He said that rapid deficit reduction was the overriding priority, and
    that it would involve fiscal tightening of such scale and severity that it would
    have to begin immediately. He said that the faster we cut, the better it would
    be for confidence. He said that there was no choice, and that the markets demanded
    this action. He also said that no alternative was possible and that anyone who
    said otherwise was a deficit denier.</p><p pid="c.332.3/4">The Chancellor ignored
    the evidence that budget deficits had risen rapidly in every country after a global
    financial crisis caused by the irresponsible behaviour of banks around the world,
    claiming instead that the root cause of Britain&#8217;s deficit was too much spending
    on the NHS, schools and the police. He ignored the evidence that Labour&#8217;s
    balanced deficit reduction plan to support jobs and halve the deficit over four
    years was working, that the UK economy was already recovering, that tax rises
    and spending cuts had been pre-announced, and that we were over-achieving on our
    deficit reduction plan in line with the G20 commitment.</p>

  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="a.827.0/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the clause be read a Second time.</p><p class="" pid="a.827.0/2" pwmotiontext="yes">In
    the last Parliament the Prime Minister and other senior Conservatives repeatedly
    expressed their commitment to recognise marriage in the tax system. There were
    some very strong statements, particularly by the Prime Minister. For instance,
    in Glasgow, in July 2008, he said:</p><p pid="a.827.0/3">&#8220;And when it comes
    perhaps to the most important area of all, families, we will take action not just
    to support marriage and family stability&#8221;,</p><p pid="a.827.0/4">because
    he wanted to say</p><p pid="a.827.0/5">&#8220;to parents, your responsibility
    and your commitment matters, so we will give a tax break for marriage and end
    the couple penalty.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.827.0/6">That was the leader of our party
    speaking during the last Parliament. This was the key policy response to the challenge
    of social breakdown, or the &#8220;broken Britain&#8221; phenomenon, and it became
    an important manifesto pledge at the 2010 election&#8212;a manifesto pledge on
    which every Conservative MP was elected. It was a sacred bond, as it were, with
    the electorate to support marriage, which was considered to be an absolutely key
    part of dealing with broken Britain. We put that in our manifesto.</p><p pid="a.827.0/7">I
    know that our party did not win an outright majority, but the commitment, most
    importantly, got into the coalition agreement with a provision for our Lib-Dem
    friends to abstain. I am not asking them to do anything, but I am asking our Front-Bench
    team to fulfil the pledge that they solemnly made in the manifesto and put in
    the coalition agreement. We are still waiting for it, which is why new clause
    5 is so important and why I believe that, whatever else has been going on in the
    background this afternoon&#8212;I need not go into that&#8212;it was my duty to
    move it. If it had not been moved, many people involved in the Christian community
    or in the Christian Institute or in churches would have wondered why this new
    clause&#8212;clearly on the agenda this afternoon, and a vital part of what we
    are trying to achieve for Britain&#8212;had suddenly been withdrawn. I was not
    prepared to let that happen. I have therefore moved it to allow a debate, to which
    the Government should be made to respond.</p><p pid="a.827.0/8">Since the election
    the Prime Minister has reiterated his commitment to recognise marriage in the
    tax system on a number of occasions, including at his second Prime Minister&#8217;s
    Question Time&#8212;but no action has yet been taken. Given that the manifesto
    pledge is backed by the coalition agreement and pertains to the period between
    2010 and 2015, the fact that the Government have not yet acted to recognise marriage
    in the tax system is, I hope, no cause for alarm. This debate is important: the
    Minister will have to respond to it later, when he can assure us that although
    it has not been possible to do this yet, it is definitely going to happen in</p><p
    pid="a.827.0/9">this Parliament because it was in our manifesto and in the coalition
    agreement. At the very least, I want the Minister to say that.</p><p pid="a.827.0/10">Since
    the commitment to recognise marriage in the tax system was made last year, there
    have been some significant changes, which in my personal view greatly increase
    the need for swift action. In this context, the tabling of new clause 5 on Report
    to recognise marriage in the tax system is an important step. It provides an opportunity
    to put on the record the standard arguments for recognising marriage in the tax
    system and, more importantly, to set out the changes over the last 12 months that
    have greatly increased the urgency of taking action in this area. As I have said,
    the Government are obliged to respond and engage with the implications of the
    changes as they relate to the importance of recognising marriage in the tax system.</p><p
    pid="a.827.0/11">Let us go into a bit more detail. Apart from married couples
    with at least one spouse born before 1935&#8212;a number that will clearly reduce
    over the years&#8212;and couples in which at least one partner is blind, everyone
    in the United Kingdom is taxed on an individual basis. Unused tax allowances cannot
    be transferred from a non-earning spouse to an earning spouse.</p><p pid="a.827.0/12">Under
    the system of transferable allowances, which we have constantly promoted as a
    party for several years and as is envisaged in our coalition agreement, a non-earning
    spouse would be able to transfer the whole or part of the basic income tax personal
    allowance to their earning spouse. Depending on how it was introduced, the whole
    allowance or part of it could be transferable, and it could be limited to couples
    with children under a specified age, or limited to tax at the basic rate. The
    Government can decide what they can afford and they can bring it in gradually;
    there need not be dead-weight costs or the other problems that were aired in the
    previous debate. Moreover, I am not at all sure that it is appropriate to talk
    about dead-weight costs in this context at all. For 2011-12 the personal allowance
    is &#163;7,475; if the whole allowance were transferable it would be worth up
    to &#163;1,495, so we are not talking about huge sums of money.</p><p pid="a.827.0/13">Let
    us look at what other countries are doing, because it is important to nail the
    untruth that this idea comes just from the right wing of the British Tory party,
    or from the Christian community, when it is very common throughout the world.
    In fact, Britain is unusual among developed countries in failing to recognise
    marriage in the tax system. This is something that we did as a country, with cross-party
    agreement, as it was considered absolutely the right thing to do, right up to
    1999-2000. Only 24% of citizens of OECD states live in countries that do not recognise
    marriage in the tax system in one way or another, and most of those live in just
    three countries&#8212;Mexico, Turkey and the UK. We are very much in the minority
    in not recognising marriage through our tax system. Why should we not recognise
    marriage when most countries and tax administrations in the world think that marriage
    is a force for stability? It is not unusual to want to recognise that. Other developed
    countries such as France, Germany, Italy and America all recognise marriage. In
    that context it was hardly surprising to learn that, according to the latest figures&#8212;published
    in May 2010&#8212;the resulting tax burden on single-earner married families in
    the United Kingdom was one third greater than the OECD average.</p><p pid="a.827.0/14">My
    point is that the present system is unfair&#8212;unfair on single-earner families.
    Nothing in the new clause requires families to have a single earner; we are simply
    saying that if a family chooses to have one, particularly if there are young children
    and particularly if the mother wants to stay at home, that choice should be recognised.
    As I have said, such arrangements are common throughout the world, and I believe
    that the new clause is very moderate.</p>'

    shall try to observe your strictures, Mr Deputy Speaker, but this is a very large
    piece of legislation; I shall probably have to restrict the number of times I
    give way to interventions.</p><p pid="a.984.3/3">I am determined to reform the
    justice system in this country. Keeping the public safe, ensuring that those who
    break the law face the consequences and providing swift, cost-effective access
    to justice are fundamental responsibilities of the state towards its citizens.
    Yet the last 13 years of government have left us a system whose cost and scale
    have exploded and whose failings can no longer be tolerated.</p><p pid="a.984.3/4">In
    the area of criminal justice, more than 20 new Acts of Parliament, thousands of
    new criminal offences and a huge increase in the prison population cannot mask
    very deep flaws in the system. Briefly, our sentencing framework is a mess of
    byzantine complexity that even trained lawyers and judges&#8212;never mind the
    general public&#8212;find confusing.</p><p pid="a.984.3/5">Our punishments do
    not work. Community sentences are weak, asking little of offenders, and prisons
    have become so crowded that there is no space for governors to enforce regimes
    of meaningful work or reparation. Far too many prisoners are left idle in their
    cells, often on drugs. For that model, the taxpayer has the privilege of paying
    out an extraordinary sum&#8212;&#163;44,000 per prison place per year. I have
    just been assured that the Ritz is even more expensive, so I slightly exaggerated,
    but &#163;44,000 per prison place per year is enough to pay the salaries of two
    newly qualified nurses or teachers.</p>

  question: Question put, That the Bill be now read the Third time. The House proceeded
    to a Division.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="a.1468.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="a.1468.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">During
    the course of the debates on this Finance Bill we have spent some time combing
    through the details of our plans to put the economy back on course. It is a Bill
    that will help ensure the stability of our financial sector, protect the most
    vulnerable in society from the worst effects of the downturn, make Britain a better
    place to do business and stimulate private sector growth. We are clearly the Government
    who are setting the agenda on the need for a tax system that encourages growth,
    by cutting corporation tax, improving research and development tax credits, extending
    enterprise investment schemes and increasing the entrepreneurs&#8217; relief.</p><p
    pid="a.1468.2/3">To be fair, after three months of debate we have not seen much
    policy from the Opposition. Of course, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411"
    name="Edward Balls">the right hon. Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase></p><p
    pid="a.1468.2/4">proposed a temporary cut in VAT in the middle of our proceedings,
    although I cannot but draw the House&#8217;s attention to the fact that he then
    failed to table an amendment to that effect until it was too late. It fell to
    <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the
    hon. Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase>, who I
    am delighted to see here this evening, to table such an amendment. However, at
    that point the official Opposition abstained and failed to support the very policy
    for which they had been campaigning the week before. I would like to think that
    they were persuaded by the arguments made from the Dispatch Box that it was the
    wrong policy. Perhaps there is some cachet in being tax personality of the year
    after all, although on that evening not all Government Back Benchers were so easily
    persuaded by arguments from the Treasury Bench.</p><p pid="a.1468.2/5">Hon. Members
    will be aware that this is the first full Bill in which we have demonstrated our
    commitment to the principles of tax policy making that were set out in last year&#8217;s
    Budget. To paraphrase Bananarama, it ain&#8217;t just what you do, it&#8217;s
    the way that you do it. I am sure hon. Members are aware that the Treasury Committee
    published its report on our new approach to tax policy making on <phrase class="date"
    code="2011-03-15">15 March</phrase>, and that they will have noted the principles
    of good taxation set out by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in his Budget
    speech. Like the Committee, he gave his views on what the key elements of our
    tax system should be. It should support growth and encourage competition; be certain
    and predictable; be simple to understand and easy to comply with; and be fair,
    reward work, support aspiration and ask the most from those who can most afford
    it. Those principles are central to the policy making process that is reflected
    in the measures that we see in the Bill.</p><p pid="a.1468.2/6">The Bill supports
    growth in our economy, and will help to provide businesses with the most competitive
    tax system in the G20. We set out our plans for achieving that in &#8220;The Corporate
    Tax Road Map&#8221;, which was published last November. We are providing business
    with a clear understanding of our overall direction of travel; setting out the
    timetable for major areas of reform; and enabling businesses to have the confidence
    they need to invest, create new jobs and drive the recovery. John Cridland, director-general
    of CBI said, quite simply:</p><p pid="a.1468.2/7">&#8220;This Budget will help
    businesses grow and create jobs. The Chancellor has made clear the UK is open
    for business.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.1468.2/8">The Bill delivers some of the major
    changes: a cut in corporation tax to 26% this year and 25% next year, towards
    a rate of 23% in 2014, which will be the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7;
    cuts in the small-profits rates of tax; interim reforms of the controlled foreign
    corporation rules, before a full reform next year; and simplification of the rules
    relating to corporate capital gains. Those will help to deliver on making Britain
    competitive internationally, although that is not the only driver of growth: we
    are supporting British businesses through changes to the enterprise investment
    R and D tax credit schemes, making them more generous; we have doubled the rate
    of entrepreneurs relief; and we are increasing the disposal time for short-life
    assets to eight years.</p><p pid="a.1468.2/9">We set out most of the measures
    in the Bill last year, just as we set out most of the measures for next year in
    Budget 2011. We will consult on draft legislation in the autumn to allow time
    to hear from interested parties,</p><p pid="a.1468.2/10">and as I have said, we
    have set out future changes in a number of areas, including for corporate taxes.
    Certainty is what British businesses need most, and that is what this Government
    are giving them.</p><p pid="a.1468.2/11">On simplification, we recognised the
    spaghetti bowl of complexity in the tax system, so last summer we set up the Office
    of Tax Simplification to advise us on how to untangle matters. It has made substantial
    progress and has already examined the reliefs within the tax system. Following
    its recommendations, we have identified more than 40 reliefs for abolition, of
    which seven are repealed by the Bill. We recently launched a consultation on the
    remainder to ensure that taxpayers have sufficient notice of the changes, with
    a view to legislating next year. Furthermore, the OTS has made recommendations
    on the operational integration of income tax and national insurance contributions,
    and we announced in the Budget that we will take forward work on that. A simpler
    tax system is an easier tax system, and it reduces costs for business and the
    Government, although it may leave me with less to read on my quiet evenings in.</p><p
    pid="a.1468.2/12">The final principle outlined by the Chancellor and echoed by
    the Treasury Committee is that of fairness. We have increased the personal allowance
    by &#163;1,000, and will increase it to &#163;10,000. We are making real steps
    in every year in this Parliament. We have cut fuel duty by only 1p, as opposed
    to the 6p increase that the previous Government would have imposed. We are freezing
    vehicle excise duty for hauliers, and there will be an inflation-only increase
    in vehicle excise duty for all other motorists.</p><p pid="a.1468.2/13">We are
    supporting pensioners through the triple guarantee on state pensions and by removing
    the requirement to annuitise, and we are helping charities through changes to
    the substantial donors rules. We are taking action on tax avoidance to address
    issues that have spiralled out of control. In particular, we have introduced legislation
    to tackle disguised remuneration&#8212;the practice whereby well paid individuals
    disguise their remuneration as loans that are never repaid, which results in a
    loss to the Exchequer. That measure will raise more than &#163;700 million a year,
    and I am genuinely surprised and disappointed that it did not receive Opposition
    support in Committee. We have also introduced the bank levy to encourage banks
    to behave in a less risky manner, while ensuring that they pay their fair share.
    The tax system must be fair, and this Government are ensuring that that is so.</p><p
    pid="a.1468.2/14">When I thought that I would be making this speech on <phrase
    class="date" code="2011-07-04">4 July</phrase>, I found it easy to weave in references
    to American independence, in which taxation played such a large part. The date
    of <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-05">5 July</phrase> is a little less well
    known for historical events, although of course it was the date in 1948 on which
    the NHS was launched. My research on this day uncovered a further event of note,
    although I shall refrain from calling it historical&#8212;were <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member
    for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase> here, I would wish him a very happy birthday. I
    thank him for his constructive engagement during the passage of the Bill in Committee
    and on Report, as I do the hon. Members for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) and
    for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie). I hope that the right hon. Gentleman has found

    to the cause. It may be her 30th birthday but she is still with us in the Chamber
    today.</p><p pid="a.1468.2/16">We have a plan for deficit reduction that has been
    internationally endorsed, and we are sticking to it. We have a plan for growth&#8212;growth
    that will be driven by investment and exports, growth that is sustainable and
    growth that supports entrepreneurs throughout the country. The Bill puts in place
    the right conditions to allow British business to flourish, and I commend it to
    the House.</p>'

  question: Question put (Standing Order No. 23).
  tidied_motion:
  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="b.352.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="" pid="b.352.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to establish a programme to provide training and employment opportunities
    for unemployed young people between the ages of 16 and 25; to establish a comprehensive
    careers guidance service for young people seeking to enter the job market; to
    enable Apprenticeship Training Agencies to assist small businesses in employing
    apprentices; to provide small businesses with a National Insurance contributions
    holiday; to make provision for grants towards the wage costs of apprentices employed
    by small businesses; to make provision for a mechanism through which banks and
    other providers of financial services are required to allocate part of their bonus
    payment budget to support these measures; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="b.352.2/3">Obviously,
    I welcome the small reduction in the figures announced today, but the truth is
    that we do not really know how high youth unemployment is in this country. The
    Prince&#8217;s Trust, which does such fantastic work with young people, claims
    that there are enough unemployed young people to fill every football stadium in
    the premier league, with almost 200,000 left queuing outside. It is true that
    youth unemployment is now much higher than it was in the second quarter of 2010.
    About 1,300 young people in my Selly Oak constituency are known to be unemployed.
    We also know that we now have the highest youth unemployment since 1992, and that
    one in five young people are unemployed.</p><p pid="b.352.2/4">John Philpott,
    the chief economic adviser of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development,
    argues that the best way to understand the full impact of unemployment on young
    people is to look at those not in education, employment or training. Helpfully,
    the Department for Education publishes those figures quarterly, and we can see
    from its statistics that youth unemployment is hovering around the 1 million mark.
    That is too high for a civilised society and a modern economy. How can we be optimistic
    about the future if we are prepared to subject our young people to a life of worklessness?
    How can parents have faith in a Government who are willing to let this happen?
    I witnessed it happen to a generation in the 1980s, and I do not want to see it
    happen again. That is why I am arguing that we need a fresh initiative to tackle
    the problem.</p><p pid="b.352.2/5">I want us to create a training and employment
    programme for those aged 16 to 25, because I believe that that is the only realistic
    way to tackle a problem of that size. That kind of unemployment can have long-term
    damaging effects. It is estimated that a period of unemployment at the beginning
    of someone&#8217;s career can have a significant scarring effect through their
    entire working life. Bell and Blanchflower argue that unemployment when young,
    especially for a lengthy period, causes permanent scars. It raises the probability
    of being unemployed in later years and institutionalises a wage penalty over the
    course of a lifetime.</p><p pid="b.352.2/6">Those effects are much greater for
    younger people than for older people. Gregg and Tominey used the national child
    development study to argue that youth unemployment imposes an impact on individuals&#8217;
    wages of 12% to 15% by the age of 42. Inactive young people are also more likely
    to be involved in crime, and significantly more likely to be unemployed later
    in life, as well as</p><p pid="b.352.2/7">having a higher propensity for physical
    and mental health problems, and drug and alcohol abuse. We owe it to our young
    people to do everything we can to prevent that scar of unemployment.</p><p pid="b.352.2/8">We
    need an employment programme that offers hope and opportunity, and we need training
    designed to address the structural gaps in our system. There needs to be more
    focus on science, technology, engineering and maths to help to reduce some of
    the mismatches between young people and employers. STEM skills are essential in
    sectors that are key to the future of UK competitiveness, such as IT, pharmaceuticals
    and high-value manufacturing, yet two fifths of employers report difficulties
    in recruiting STEM-skilled staff.</p><p pid="b.352.2/9">As part of a sustained
    programme to tackle youth unemployment, we also need to sort out the mess that
    has developed in careers advice and support for young people, especially the vulnerable
    and those whom we describe as NEETs. This is exactly the wrong time for the confusion
    and doubt sweeping the country as the Connexions organisation reels under the
    weight of local government cuts. We were told that cuts in the Department for
    Education area grant would have a limited impact, but we now see careers advice
    across the country decimated. In Birmingham the jobs of 200 Connexions staff are
    in doubt, and in some parts of the country provision is already being reduced
    to little more than online advice and a telephone help service. Barnardo&#8217;s,
    which specialises in work with vulnerable young people, says that it is extremely
    concerned that the closure of Connexions centres will leave many young people
    without advice and support this summer.</p><p pid="b.352.2/10">When the Tory party
    talked about an &#8220;all-age careers service&#8221; in its pre-coalition, pre-election
    manifesto&#8212;we should remember that that is what people thought they were
    voting for&#8212;I wonder how many realised that that was code for transferring
    specialised support to Jobcentre Plus advisers. I am sure that those advisers
    do a good job, but they do not have specialised skills in working with young people,
    and of course they can work only with the 16 and 17-year-olds who receive jobseeker&#8217;s
    allowance, which means they will not be helping the vulnerable, such as the NEETs,
    and those who too easily slip through the net.</p><p pid="b.352.2/11">The Federation
    of Small Businesses, whose knowledge and experience of small businesses we should
    listen to, is calling for a nationwide effort to encourage apprenticeship training
    agencies to act as host employers for small businesses. It points out that only
    8% of small businesses have taken on an apprentice in the past year, but that
    14% would be encouraged to do so if a separate organisation dealt with matters
    such as training, administration and employment.</p><p pid="b.352.2/12">The FSB
    is urging the National Apprenticeship Service in England to promote the benefits
    of apprenticeship training agencies to small and micro-businesses. It is also
    calling for a national insurance contributions holiday to help small businesses
    to give our youngsters a chance. The current national insurance holiday helps
    only start-ups that employ up to 10 people. It may come as a surprise to hon.
    Members, but start-ups employing 10 people are not common&#8212;the FSB says that
    most of its 205,000 members actually employ five or fewer staff.</p><p pid="b.352.2/13">Government
    data suggest that about 3,000 businesses are benefiting from the current scheme,
    but the Government promised that 300,000 businesses would be set up as a result
    of it. That suggests that money is available to help micro-businesses that employ
    five or fewer staff. Ultimately, the Treasury would benefit from extending a national
    insurance holiday, because more people would pay tax.</p><p pid="b.352.2/14">Youth
    unemployment costs more than &#163;23 million in benefits every week, and lost
    productivity costs about &#163;10 million a day: &#163;600 million pounds would
    be enough to fund 100,000 young people directly, and perhaps more, in a proper
    Government work and training programme. It could also be used to stimulate businesses,
    which could mean that 10,000 more youngsters were given a chance.</p><p pid="b.352.2/15">The
    public are ahead of us on this matter, because they know that we should fund such
    a programme from a levy on the money set aside for unearned bonuses for wealthy
    bankers, who are continuing to pay themselves money that they have not earned
    while the rest of the country suffers as a result. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>'

    people face a more uncertain future which may not offer the increased opportunities
    and prosperity enjoyed by their parents and their grandparents; notes that, following
    the Government&#8217;s decision to cut public spending too far and too fast, it
    has targeted young people with cuts, resulting in nearly one million young people
    not in education, employment or training; further notes with concern that there
    were no university places for around 100,000 applicants this year, that tuition
    fees are trebling, university places will be cut next year and many universities
    will lose popular courses; highlights that the proportion of apprenticeship places
    for 16 to 18 year olds has decreased by 11 per cent., new apprenticeships are
    providing mainly short-term training for older workers, the Future Jobs Fund has
    been scrapped, the apprenticeship guarantee abandoned, Education Maintenance Allowance
    ended, homelessness has risen and homebuilding is at a 90-year low; believes the
    Government must take action to secure business growth to create opportunities
    for young people; resolves that the Government should repeat the bank bonus levy
    to create over 100,000 jobs through a youth jobs fund, to build 25,000 affordable
    homes and to support business through increased funding for the Regional Growth
    Fund; calls on the Government to expand apprenticeships for young people and to
    ensure that public sector contractors offer apprenticeships; and further calls
    on the Government to enact a temporary VAT cut to boost consumer spending, business
    confidence and support the UK&#8217;s high streets.</p><p pid="a.899.2/3">The

    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" name="Andy Burnham">the Member for Leigh (Andy
    Burnham)</phrase> and others. I thank the Minister for Further Education, Skills
    and Lifelong Learning, who has given his apologies for his absence this afternoon,
    which is for understandable reasons. I see that the Secretary of State for Business,
    Innovation and Skills is not here to answer the debate; he seems to be curiously
    reluctant to answer when I introduce Opposition day debates, but no doubt he is
    trying to work out how to be selected as the coalition candidate for Richmond
    at the next election.</p><p pid="a.899.2/4">We British people have always been
    confident that each new generation will do better than their parents and their
    grandparents. There have been wars and economic crises, and individual families
    have had their ups and downs, but what my right hon. Friend the leader of the
    Labour party calls &#8220;the promise of Britain&#8221; has held true. Parents
    have been able to say, &#8220;Our children have had more opportunities, a better
    education and a higher standard of living than we had.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.899.2/5">However,
    Members on both sides of the House will know that confidence in that British promise
    has never been more shaky, knowing that the average age of a first-time buyer
    is approaching 40, and that there are 1 million young people not in employment,
    education or training. At the same time, we have all heard young people asking
    whether the cost of a degree is worth it, and what the alternative would be. We
    have all heard parents asking how this country will pay its way in a fiercely
    competitive world, and what young people will do. Only a quarter of parents and
    grandparents questioned by YouGov believed that their young would be better off
    than they were.</p><p pid="a.899.2/6">Today, the Opposition are asking the House
    to focus on things that the Government should and should not have done, but let
    us be clear: the challenges did not suddenly emerge from a blue sky at the last
    election. The Minister for Universities and Science advocates the view that over
    decades, the older generation has in some way stolen the future from young people,
    and that we have so rigged the rules of the game throughout our lives that the
    young have only half a chance&#8212;I apologise if I paraphrase cruelly. We hear
    similar views across the political spectrum. Whether or not we share them&#8212;I
    have very strong reservations&#8212;it is clear that the generation now in power
    has a huge responsibility to young people, and that the changes that are needed
    in our economy and society are profound. Those changes will take leadership, which
    Labour will offer, over many years.</p><p pid="a.899.2/7">However, I would not
    be doing young people any favours if I pretended that it was only in the past
    year that everything had gone wrong.</p>'

    cent. growth in the previous nine months; further notes that families are feeling
    the squeeze, unemployment is rising again and the recovery was choked off last
    autumn, well before the eurozone crisis of recent months; agrees with the International

    credibility&#8217; and the IMF&#8217;s recent report which warned that &#8216;if

    the Government should &#8216;consider delaying some of their planned consolidation&#8217;;
    further notes that borrowing is forecast to be &#163;46 billion higher than planned
    because of the slower growth and higher unemployment arising from the Government&#8217;s
    policy of cutting spending and raising taxes too far and too fast; further believes
    that the Government need a plan for jobs and growth if the deficit is to be reduced
    in a sustainable way; and calls on the Government to implement a steadier deficit
    plan and the Opposition&#8217;s five point plan for jobs, which includes a tax
    on bank bonuses to fund 100,000 jobs for young people, bringing forward long-term
    investment projects, reversing temporarily the VAT increase to provide an average
    &#163;450 increase for a couple with children, implementing a one-year cut in
    VAT on home improvements, repairs and maintenance to five per cent, and a one-year
    national insurance tax break for small firms taking on extra workers.</p><p pid="a.356.2/3">In
    opening this Opposition debate on the economy and moving our motion urging the
    Government to kick-start Britain&#8217;s choked-off recovery and adopt Labour&#8217;s
    five-point plan for jobs and growth, I shall start by setting out the facts for
    the House and for the country. Over the past year the British economy has ground
    to a complete halt. The latest figures show no growth at all since last autumn.
    Consumer and business confidence has slumped. For three months manufacturing output
    has been falling. More than 16,000 companies have gone out of business. Employment
    is falling and today&#8217;s chilling news is that unemployment has risen by 114,000
    in the past three months alone.</p><p pid="a.356.2/4">Unemployment here in Britain
    now stands at 2.57 million people out of work&#8212;the highest level since 1994.
    Unemployment is rising across the country. We have the highest level of unemployment
    among women since 1988. Most worryingly of all, youth unemployment, which a year
    ago was falling, is now rising again, up 74,000 in the past three months, with
    991,000&#8212;more than one in five&#8212;young people out of work. There has
    been a 60% rise in youth long-term unemployment since February, and the overall
    level of youth long-term unemployment is at its highest for 19 years. What a waste
    of talent, what a waste of money and what a betrayal of this young generation.</p>

    on the Public Bill Committee for their help in scrutinising the Bill. They have
    had to hang around for quite a long time, but we are where we are now. I also
    thank the Opposition for their approach to many of the positive debates on the

    legislation through this House. If there is anybody in government who has championed
    the cause of the low-paid in pensions, it is him. It is a privilege and pleasure
    to work with him in this coalition&#8212;a very firm coalition in our case. On
    a departmental point, may I back him up on what he said about one of our civil
    servants, Evelyn Arnold, whom <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226"
    name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>
    knows? She is retiring after a long time and has seen so many of these things
    go through, and it is right for us to thank those who</p><p pid="b.849.4/4">serve
    us without normal comment. So, without question, I thank her for the time she
    has spent, on behalf of all parties in government, getting this sort of legislation
    through.</p><p pid="b.849.4/5">Over the past few months, a number of amendments
    were made that I believe have improved the Bill, and I shall run through them.
    With the blessing of the House, I do not intend to spend much time on them because
    we have been through them a lot. Amendment 1 related to the consumer prices index
    underpin, where we have listened to concerns and responded by ensuring that schemes
    that use the retail prices index will not have to uprate by CPI in the years when
    it is higher. We have heard the issues raised on deferred member charges and,
    having listened, we have extended an existing reserve power to cap charges to
    also cover deferred members. That enables the Government to protect all scheme
    members from high charges regardless of what might come in the future, which is
    an important feature. Thirdly, we have also made an amendment to clarify the definition
    of money purchase benefits in light of the Supreme Court&#8217;s recent judgment
    in Houldsworth <i>v. </i>Bridge, ensuring that schemes and members continue to
    have adequate protection.</p><p pid="b.849.4/6">The House will be aware that we
    have listened and responded to concerns about the women most affected by the accelerated
    rise in the state pension age. Last week we announced that no women will see their
    state pension age increase by more than 18 months. We have always been clear that
    our policy will not change and we will still equalise the state pension age by
    2018 and increase it to 66 by 2020. We have, however, honoured the commitment
    I gave on Second Reading to ease the transition process for those who are most
    affected. I listened with interest to the debate, but the point that is sometimes
    missed is that the adjustment means that nearly 250,000 women will have a lower
    state pension age as a result of the change, as will a similar number of men:
    500,000 people at a cost of just over &#163;1 billion in the next spending period.
    We should not sniff at that.</p>'

    debate, and the amount of interest generated in advance of it has surely put beyond
    any doubt the fact that the public are concerned about this matter. It fully vindicates
    the establishment of the Committee, and its decision to facilitate the debate.
    I thank my hon. Friends the Members for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron), for
    Christchurch (Mr Chope), for Clacton (Mr Carswell), for Rochester and Strood (Mark
    Reckless) and for Wycombe (Steve Baker), along with many others, for their tireless

    pid="d.46.3/8">The motion reflects the wishes of the hundreds of thousands of
    people who have signed petitions calling for a referendum on the United Kingdom&#8217;s
    future relationship with the European Union. Opinion polls clearly show that millions
    of others agree with them: in fact, the vast majority of the British people want
    a vote in a referendum. The arguments for and against the United Kingdom&#8217;s
    membership of the European Union can wait until a future referendum campaign.
    The motion that is before us today simply paves the way for a referendum to be
    held on some future, as yet unspecified, date. Therefore, any argument that now
    is not the right time for a referendum to be held is, quite frankly, irrelevant.
    Even if the motion is passed today, a referendum is likely to be years away.</p><p
    pid="d.46.3/9">One reason for people&#8217;s increasing concern about our membership
    of the European Union is the growing sense that this country, indeed this Parliament,
    is becoming ever more impotent as more and more decisions are taken in Brussels
    and then passed down to the United Kingdom to implement, whether we like it or
    not.</p><p pid="d.46.3/10">I want to mention one very important example of that
    from my constituency of Bury North. Before the last general election, the Conservatives
    pledged that if</p><p pid="d.46.3/11">we won the election we would keep open the
    children&#8217;s department, including the maternity ward and special care baby
    unit, at Fairfield hospital in Bury, which was scheduled to close under Labour&#8217;s
    plans. Sadly, despite that pledge, and despite massive local opposition to the
    closure plans, these vital services are still destined to close, and one of the
    driving forces behind the closure plans is the effect of the European working
    time directive. Thousands of my constituents feel completely let down, and even
    at this late stage I urge the Government to keep that pre-election pledge and
    to ensure these services are retained at Fairfield hospital.</p>'

    class="" pid="a.323.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House recalls that the Prime
    Minister made a series of personal pledges on the NHS in the run up to the General
    Election which were carried over to the Coalition Agreement; believes it is now
    clear he has failed to honour three of the headline commitments in the Coalition
    Agreement; notes firstly that Treasury figures from July 2011 confirm that NHS
    spending fell in real terms in 2010-11, contrary to the guarantee that health
    spending will increase in real terms in each year of the Parliament; notes secondly
    recent central approval of changes to hospital services, in breach of a moratorium
    on such changes; notes thirdly the Prime Minister&#8217;s continuation, despite
    widespread opposition, with the Health and Social Care Bill, contrary to the pledge
    in the Coalition Agreement to stop top-down reorganisations of the NHS; believes
    there is mounting evidence that the combination of an unprecedented financial
    challenge combined with the biggest reorganisation in the history of the NHS is
    damaging patient care and leading to longer waiting times; is concerned that huge
    cuts to adult social care in England will further limit hospitals&#8217; ability
    to cope with coming winter pressures; and calls on the Government to listen to
    GPs and NHS staff, drop the Bill and accept the offer of cross-party talks on
    reforming NHS commissioning.</p><p pid="a.323.2/3">We read today that the Government
    were in open retreat last night on their Health and Social Care Bill in the House
    of Lords. Given that, we thought it only right to bring the Secretary of State
    here today to be held to account by this elected House. He tried to shuffle off
    his responsibilities and dug in when the Bill was in this place, only to give
    in down there. That came just hours after he had to confirm that he would still
    take oral questions in this House, despite a claim to the contrary by his preferred
    candidate to take over the running of the NHS. The Secretary of State may be on
    the run, but we will not let him hide. Our NHS is too precious to too many people
    in this country to be carved up in dodgy coalition deals in the unelected House.
    His Bill is unravelling before his eyes, and coalition health policy is in chaos.
    Today, we hold him to account for that.</p><p pid="a.323.2/4">To be fair to the
    right hon. Gentleman, the responsibility is not all his. It goes right up to the
    door of No. 10 Downing street. People will remember only too well, in the run-up
    to the general election, the then Leader of the Opposition&#8217;s ostentatious
    shows of affection for the NHS, his airbrushed face on the posters and three very
    personal promises&#8212;real-terms increases in every year of this Parliament,
    no accident and emergency or maternity closures, and no top-down reorganisation
    of the NHS. He protested his love for the NHS, and at photo call after photo call
    on the wards he routinely wore his heart on his sleeve. As we now know, he was
    protesting a little too much, and today we expose the hollowness of his promises.</p>

    the conclusion of many hours of copious debate on the Floor of the House and in
    Committee, I pay tribute to members of the Bill team from my Department, who have
    been working throughout on this marathon Bill, and to my two colleagues, the Under-Secretary
    of State for Justice, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40326"

    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" name="Crispin Blunt">the Member for Reigate
    (Mr Blunt)</phrase> who, I am glad to say, carried the burden of the day in Committee
    and most of it on Report as well. I am grateful to them all.</p><p pid="a.1042.0/3">It
    is an enormous Bill representing a major reform of the criminal justice system
    and the justice system generally. It is overdue and the Government have made a
    good start on sorting out some of the problems facing the justice system. I shall
    mention briefly the legal aid reforms, which have been debated again today. They
    are extremely important. They make substantial savings and I acknowledge that
    we have had to make some difficult choices.</p><p pid="a.1042.0/4">I am a lawyer
    and I have many friends who are practising lawyers. When I was given this post,
    I wondered whether I would retain any friends in the legal profession by the time
    we got to Christmas. I am glad to say that I have, but some difficult decisions
    have been taken at the expense of some members of the profession, who have already
    suffered reductions in their fees as a result of the previous Government&#8217;s
    changes, and have probably had a bigger reduction in their fee income, I concede,
    than almost any other group in the country. So let us acknowledge that there are
    people facing consequences as a result of what we have done, but it was much overdue.</p><p
    pid="a.1042.0/5">We have, as we keep saying, the most expensive legal aid system
    in the world. It has gone far beyond what could be afforded. The previous Government
    made repeated attempts to reform it and kept consulting on reforms and making
    changes. Even then they found, by the end of their period of office, that real-terms
    spending on legal aid had gone up quite substantially, compared with when they
    took office.</p><p pid="a.1042.0/6">What we have done is not just a cheese-paring
    exercise across the whole field of legal aid. We have gone back to first principles
    and asked what is essential that the</p><p pid="a.1042.0/7">taxpayer pays for
    to assure access to justice on truly important matters for that section of society
    that must have access to justice in the public interest, so that we can all be
    assured that people get the protections that they are entitled to under our constitution.
    That is what we have debated, one by one.</p><p pid="a.1042.0/8">I believe that
    the package that we have come up with will make substantial savings. As I was
    saying to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40295" name="Andy
    Slaughter">the hon. Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter)</phrase> a few moments
    ago, the idea that we are launching some assault on access to justice and depriving
    people of access to justice is nonsense. We are not affecting the right. There
    is no change in the Bill to any particular course of action. Legal aid is available,
    but it is available to the poorest people for those really essential matters that
    affect their life, liberty, home and so on, and we have got it back under control.</p>

    class="" pid="a.366.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that the
    Government&#8217;s policies of cutting spending and raising taxes too far and
    too fast have resulted in the UK economy flat-lining for 12 months, well before
    the recent Eurozone crisis; notes that unemployment has reached a 17-year high
    and youth unemployment has hit a record level of 991,000; further notes that slower
    growth and higher unemployment makes it harder to get the deficit down and that
    the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts &#163;46 billion more borrowing
    than the Government planned; further believes that with long-term youth unemployment
    up by 64 per cent. since January 2011 it was a mistake to abolish the Future Jobs
    Fund and urgent action is now required to stop a generation of young people being
    lost to worklessness; agrees with the IMF&#8217;s warning that &#8216;consolidating
    too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects&#8217; and that the
    Government should have &#8216;a heightened readiness to respond, particularly
    if it looks like the economy is headed for a prolonged period of weak growth and
    high unemployment&#8217;; and calls on the Government to adopt the Opposition&#8217;s
    five point plan for jobs which includes using funds raised from a tax on bank
    bonuses to guarantee a job for 100,000 young people and build 25,000 affordable
    homes, bringing forward long-term investment projects, temporarily reversing January&#8217;s
    VAT rise, a one-year cut in VAT to five per cent. on home improvements and a one-year
    national insurance tax break for every small firm which takes on extra workers.</p><p
    pid="a.366.1/3">I am glad to have the opportunity to open this Opposition day
    debate on youth unemployment, but sad not to see the Secretary of State in his
    place on the Treasury Bench. This is the second such debate we have had on youth
    unemployment, and it is the second such debate in which the Secretary of State
    has not been in the Chamber to present the Government&#8217;s argument. I am glad
    we have the opportunity to debate the motion today because next week we will see
    figures that could show youth unemployment has risen above 1 million, but I hope
    that it will come down. Today we have a chance to force the Government to come
    to the House to explain their complete failure to address the crisis now unfolding
    in almost every community in this country: the crisis of youth unemployment and
    the re-emergence of scars that we thought had gone from communities, never to
    return.</p><p pid="a.366.1/4">When we debated this issue in February, we heard
    some pretty complacent arguments from Treasury Front Benchers. Indeed, we had
    the spectacle of a Minister trying to blame the rise in youth unemployment unfolding
    on his watch on what happened five years ago. I hope we do not have that spectacle
    again this afternoon, because it is about time that the Government had the guts
    to take responsibility for their decisions.</p><p pid="a.366.1/5">In the past
    few weeks, the chorus of voices raising the alarm about youth unemployment has
    grown loud and wide. Yesterday, the Trades Union Congress confirmed that youth
    unemployment has now risen in 97% of communities. Last Friday, the Work Foundation
    urged Ministers to take urgent action to help the lost generation or risk a crisis
    in Britain&#8217;s communities. Last week, the CBI said:</p><p pid="a.366.1/6">&#8220;youth
    unemployment presents a specific and urgent challenge.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.366.1/7">Last
    month, the chief executive of the Prince&#8217;s Trust said that the number of
    unemployed young people is now twice the size of the population of Manchester
    and:</p><p pid="a.366.1/8">&#8220;If we fail to tackle youth unemployment now,
    we risk losing this talent forever which would be a tragedy.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.366.1/9">My
    constituency has the highest level of youth unemployment in the country, and throughout
    the summer residents have been telling me that we have got to do more to help
    our young people&#8212;people like Deborah Gillespie from Shard End who said:</p><p
    pid="a.366.1/10">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking since June for a job for my 16
    year old. No jobs for him! He is a hard-worker. No-one will give him a chance.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="a.366.1/11">One of her neighbours has said:</p><p pid="a.366.1/12">&#8220;As
    I am an older person, I must say I do feel sorry for out-of-work youth. My own
    24-year-old is out on the dole. They lose what little self-respect they once had.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="a.366.1/13">When I asked what young people needed, my constituents&#8217;
    answer was pretty straightforward: work and to help them feel worthy. I know that
    what my constituents have been saying to me will have been echoed in constituencies
    around the country.</p>'

    class="" pid="b.321.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes with concern
    that UK economic growth is flatlining and was choked off well before the recent
    Eurozone crisis, that youth unemployment is now more than one million and that
    Government borrowing is therefore expected to be &#163;46 billion higher than
    forecast over the Parliament; further notes with regret that the Government has
    failed to deliver a credible growth plan, is undermining critical industries in
    which the UK must compete, is failing to use strategically procurement and other
    tools to drive growth and innovation, and is holding back regional growth with
    its flagship projects mired in inertia and with most business still waiting for
    Regional Growth Fund money seven months after the recipients were announced; therefore
    calls on the Government to deliver a growth plan that provides an immediate boost
    to the economy to increase demand and growth, including a &#163;2 billion tax
    on bank bonuses to fund 100,000 jobs for young people and build 25,000 more affordable
    homes; and further calls on the Government to bring forward long-term investment
    projects to get people back to work, to reverse the damaging VAT rise of January
    2011 for a temporary period giving families a &#163;450 boost and providing immediate
    help for the UK&#8217;s high streets, to provide a one-year cut in VAT to five
    per cent. on home improvements, repairs and maintenance to help home owners and
    small businesses, and to provide a one-year national insurance tax break for small
    firms to help them grow and create jobs.</p><p pid="b.321.2/3">In his Conservative
    party conference speech last October, the Chancellor said he would stick to his
    plan to cut faster than any other Chancellor in our history, regardless of the
    consequences, because, he said, it was necessary to put our economy on a sound
    footing. With reference to the Business Secretary he said:</p><p pid="b.321.2/4">&#8220;Together,
    Vince and I have started to open Britain for business.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.321.2/5">A
    year later, what do we find? The economy has grown by just 0.5% in the past 12
    months. This compares with growth of 1.5% in the US over the same period and is
    significantly down from the 2.6% growth in the previous 12 months, thanks to the
    measures taken by the Labour Government. Have the Chancellor and the Business
    Secretary opened Britain for business? The figures tell a different story. The
    number of UK enterprises fell by 20,000 in the year to March 2011, with decreases
    in business numbers in every region except London and Scotland, and business confidence
    nose-dived following the announcement of the Chancellor&#8217;s spending review.</p><p
    pid="b.321.2/6">What effect is this having on the people of this country? More
    than 2.6 million people are out of work, the highest rate in 17 years. More than
    1 million young people are now out of work, the highest since comparable records
    began in 1992. Let me be clear: these are not our statistics. They are those of
    the Office for National Statistics. They are the facts.</p><p pid="b.321.2/7">How
    have the Government responded to the facts? Last week, when we learned of the
    youth unemployment figures, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor were nowhere
    to be seen. Instead, the Minister with responsibility for employment took to the
    airwaves. He told us that the 1 million figure for youth unemployment was &#8220;a
    distraction.&#8221; The 1 million figure for youth unemployment is not a distraction.
    It is a disgrace. What a tragic waste</p><p pid="b.321.2/8">of talent. He not
    only described the figure of 1 million as a distraction, but attempted to blame
    it on the eurozone crisis. Does he really think that the British people will fall
    for that?</p><p pid="b.321.2/9">In fairness to the Business Secretary, when the
    figures came out his unofficial spokesperson, the noble Lord Oakeshott, told <i>The
    Guardian</i>:</p><p pid="b.321.2/10">&#8220;It&#8217;s ridiculous to blame this
    rise in unemployment on the crisis in the eurozone. All economists know it&#8217;s
    a lagging indicator, so this is the result of what has been happening in our economy
    over the past year&#8221;.</p><p pid="b.321.2/11">I could not put it better myself.
    Despite that view, the Business Secretary remains resolutely wedded to the Government&#8217;s
    economic strategy, however disastrous it is turning out to be. He does so in the
    name of deficit reduction, yet the independent forecasts published last week show
    that the Government are projected to borrow, on average, more in each remaining
    year of this Parliament than we would have done under our more balanced deficit
    reduction plan. Those are neither the Opposition&#8217;s figures, nor those published
    by the Office for National Statistics; the summary of independent forecasts was
    published last week by the Government themselves. Of course, the Office for Budget
    Responsibility has already forecast borrowing to be &#163;46 billion higher than
    previously thought. The evidence is clear: the Government&#8217;s strategy is
    not working because reducing borrowing requires growth, which they choked off
    by cutting spending and raising taxes too far and too fast, and long before the
    eurozone crisis.</p>'

    the desire of the British people for a rebalancing of the relationship with our
    European neighbours based on co-operation and mutually beneficial economic arrangements.</p><p
    pid="a.710.2/3">Yesterday in the House the Prime Minister referred to a period
    of great change in Europe. There is a sense arising out of the European Council
    at the weekend that something very significant has happened in terms of the United
    Kingdom and our relationship with the European Union. A taboo has been broken.
    For the first time in living memory, a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has
    gone to an EU summit not only prepared to say no but, in the event, actually using
    the veto when it became necessary in our national interest. I commend the Prime
    Minister for sticking to his word and wielding the veto in the circumstances that
    he outlined in this House last week. I have to say with regret that that is not
    something that we have come to expect from British Governments. We have been more
    used to Ministers going to crucial EU meetings in recent years and coming back
    having to explain why the latest EU regulation or measure is being implemented
    despite the implications for our national interests.</p><p pid="a.710.2/4">It

    that a large number of people from all backgrounds, whether they are Tory, Labour,
    Liberal Democrat or support parties in Northern Ireland, agree with what the Prime

    House meets to debate the motion after more grim news on jobs this morning. Grim
    news on jobs this month has followed grim news on the Budget last month. Once
    again we have seen this morning how the Chancellor&#8217;s decision to clobber
    the recovery is clobbering families all over our country. Once again we have heard
    of families losing their jobs because of this Government&#8217;s decision to cut
    too far and too fast, and once again we see the consequences of this Government&#8217;s
    decision to stand easy while millions of people in our country are now standing

    128,000, employment down, vacancies down and the public sector now losing jobs
    13 times faster than the private sector is creating them. We do not have to look
    very far for the root cause of this unalloyed misery for families 11 days before
    Christmas. The Chancellor laid it out for us just a fortnight ago. Last year he
    was boasting about delivering cuts that were &#163;40 billion greater than the
    cuts planned by Labour. Last year he was boasting about how Britain had suddenly
    become a safe haven. Last year he was so pleased with himself that he said this

  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="b.79.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p><p class="" pid="b.79.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">It
    is a relief to be called after all that waiting, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p><p pid="b.79.2/3">The
    coalition agreement committed the Government to supporting sustainable growth
    and enterprise, balanced across the country. It also pledged the radical devolution
    of power and greater financial autonomy to local government. This Bill delivers
    on those promises. It aims to introduce much-needed reforms to make England&#8217;s
    local government finance system more effective at supporting local jobs, local
    firms and local enterprises. This is not just about redistributing a pot of cash
    differently; it is about providing the best possible chances to foster more growth,
    generate more cash and make a bigger pot.</p><p pid="b.79.2/4">The case for change
    is widely recognised. The OECD has called the English local government finance
    system one of the most centralised in the world. The Labour Government knew that,
    but failed to deliver on reform. There were Green Papers, White Papers, the &#8220;Balance
    of Funding&#8221; report, the Lyons inquiry and, if that was not enough, the Labour
    party manifesto at the last general election boldly pledged another commission
    on local government finance. What little reform was introduced, such as the so-called
    local authority business growth incentive scheme, was timid, inconsistent and
    ineffective. The only thing Labour managed to do was to double council tax and
    halve local services, such as bin collections&#8212;pay more and get less.</p><p
    pid="b.79.2/5">Where others have failed to deliver, however, the coalition is
    ready to act. Nowhere is the need for change more apparent than in relation to
    business rates. Currently, councils collect rates for local businesses, but they
    are no more than the agents for central Government. No sooner is the cash in than
    Whitehall whisks it away. Whitehall feeds the figures into a very complex formula.
    Each council waits with bated breath to see how much it will get back. The 160-page
    local government finance report requires a detailed knowledge of multiple regression
    to fathom it out.</p><p pid="b.79.2/6">The system creates a perverse regime of
    incentives. Councils that work hardest to boost local businesses do not see their
    efforts reflected in the state of their finances. In fact, local economies that
    become more successful can effectively see their central Government grant cut.
    The regime actively encouraged councils to talk down their area, to mask their
    success and to amplify their deprivation; it breeds a begging-bowl mentality and
    a race to the bottom. Surely, now more than ever, we should welcome growth and
    reward incentives.</p><p pid="b.79.2/7">There is some criticism that Labour failed
    to deliver on its election pledges. Well, we are here to help. In the Localism
    Act 2011, we introduced a general power of competence, implementing a pledge in
    the 1983 Labour party manifesto. However, we have now moved on to the 1997 Labour
    party manifesto, and we are moving towards the localisation of business rates.
    The Government believe that councils should have every possible incentive to encourage
    local business, support local jobs and create the conditions for the local economy
    to thrive.</p><p pid="b.79.2/8">The Bill paves the way to repatriating business
    rates. We want to give councils a greater proportion of the rates they raise locally.
    Every council that grows its business rate base can be sure that it will see an
    increase in its income, compared to the status quo. Putting in place the right
    incentives gives every council every possible reason to go for growth, which creates
    the potential to raise more cash overall to invest in local services and local
    community priorities. Of course, we have heard a few grumbles already.</p>

    class="" pid="b.206.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that the
    scale of increases to rail and bus fares and the high cost of fuel are significantly
    increasing the transport sector&#8217;s contribution to the cost of living crisis
    facing households up and down the UK; notes that, despite the Chancellor&#8217;s
    announcement in his Autumn Statement that rail fares would rise this month by
    1 per cent. above inflation, many commuters have found their tickets have gone
    up by as much as 11 per cent.; recognises that this is a direct result of the
    decision to give back to train companies the right to add a further increase of
    up to 5 per cent., resulting in the cost of getting to work rising to more than
    the cost of monthly mortgage or rent payments for many families; notes with concern
    the National Audit Office&#8217;s warning to the Department for Transport that
    higher rail fares are likely to lead to higher profits for train operating companies;
    deplores the Government&#8217;s decision to levy even higher increases of 3 per
    cent. above inflation for 2013 and 2014; and calls on the Government to end the
    right of train companies to increase regulated tickets by more than the cap set
    by Ministers, so as to prevent fare increases of up to 13 per cent. that could
    otherwise hit passengers in each of the next two years.</p><p pid="b.206.2/3">This
    has not been a happy new year for many commuters. Having been promised by the
    Chancellor in his autumn statement that he was keeping increases in rail fares
    at just 1% above inflation, many had a nasty shock as they returned to work last
    week&#8212;not fare rises of 1% above inflation, but increases of up to almost
    11%. Season tickets between Chester and Crewe are up by 10.6% on a year ago, and
    tickets between Llandudno and Bangor hiked by the same double-digit increase,
    10.6%. Return tickets are also up&#8212;Exeter to London, for example, up by 9.6%,
    Cardiff to London by 9.7% and Plymouth to London by 9.7%.</p><p pid="b.206.2/4">But
    what did the Chancellor tell the House in November? He said:</p><p pid="b.206.2/5">&#8220;RPI
    plus 3% is too much. The Government will fund a reduction in the increase to RPI
    plus 1%. This will apply across national rail regulated fares, across the London
    tube and on London buses. It will help the millions of people who use our trains.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase

    would have done, except that the Chancellor forgot to say that his Government
    had quietly given back to train companies the right to add up to another 5% on
    fares, provided the increases averaged out at the cap that he had set, giving
    the train companies back the right to fiddle the fares.</p>

    Discount in 2012; calls on the Government to require energy companies to provide
    the lowest tariff to over 75s and use their profits to ensure that all families
    eligible for Cold Weather Payments receive the Warm Homes Discount; and further
    calls on the Government to reform the energy market to make it competitive and
    responsible, to cut VAT on home improvements to 5 per cent. for 12 months and
    to ensure that the Green Deal is offered on fair terms to consumers which will
    deliver real savings in energy bills.</p><p pid="b.251.2/3">May I wish you a happy
    new year, Mr Deputy Speaker?</p><p pid="b.251.2/4">Less than three months ago,
    the Opposition warned that soaring energy bills were driving up inflation, squeezing
    household budgets and contributing to the cost of living crisis afflicting millions
    of families. We warned, too, that trust in the energy sector had fallen to dangerously
    low levels as people grew sick and tired of the energy companies&#8217; sharp
    practices. We set out a clear plan to provide real help now, as well as to reform
    the way in which our energy market works. We called on the Government to investigate
    the scandal of mis-selling, and to ensure that people were properly compensated.
    We also urged them to simplify tariffs, in order to put an end to the disgrace
    of four out of five families paying more for their energy than they needed to.
    We asked for more transparency on energy companies&#8217; trading data, so that
    the public could see for themselves how much the companies were paying for their
    energy, as well as how much they were charging for it. We argued for a radical
    overhaul of the way in which our energy market was structured, to break the dominance
    of the big six and increase competition in order to drive down bills for families
    and businesses. We also called on the Government to make the energy companies
    use their record profits to help people with their bills this winter.</p><p pid="b.251.2/5">The
    Government did something unusual&#8212;so unusual that the Government Whip on
    the Front Bench at the time seemed surprised by it. They backed our motion. They
    agreed to support our plans. Indeed, commenting on the Labour motion, the Secretary
    of State said that</p><p pid="b.251.2/6">&#8220;there is nothing we disagree with&#8221;.</p><p
    pid="b.251.2/7">He went on to say that</p><p pid="b.251.2/8">&#8220;sympathy from
    the sidelines is not enough. It is our responsibility to do everything we can
    to help.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-10-19.944"><i>Official
    Report</i>, 19 October 2011; Vol. 533, c. 944</phrase>.]</p><p pid="b.251.2/9">Today,
    however, the scale of the Government&#8217;s failure is clear. More families are
    in fuel poverty and struggling to heat their homes. Consumer Focus says that a
    quarter of all households in England and Wales&#8212;5.7 million in all&#8212;are
    now in fuel poverty. National Energy Action fears that the figure could be as
    high as 6.6 million. These are levels not seen since the dog days of the last
    Conservative Government. The number of households in debt to their electricity
    and gas suppliers is up, too, but energy companies&#8217; profit margins are still
    in excess of &#163;100 per customer per year.</p>

    an important role for the private sector in supporting the delivery of NHS care;
    welcomes the contribution made by private providers to the delivery of the historic
    18-week maximum wait for NHS patients; recognises a need, however, for agreed
    limits on private sector involvement in the NHS; notes with concern the Government&#8217;s
    plans to open up the NHS as a regulated market, increasing private sector involvement
    in both commissioning and provision of NHS services; urges the Government to revisit
    its plans, learning from the recent problems with PIP implants and the private
    cosmetic surgery industry; believes its plan for a 49 per cent. private income
    cap for Foundation Trusts, in the context of the hospitals as autonomous business
    units and a &#8216;no bail-outs&#8217; culture, signals a fundamental departure
    from established practice in NHS hospitals; fears that the Government&#8217;s
    plans will lead to longer waiting times, will increase health inequalities and
    risk putting profits before patients; is concerned that this House has not been
    given an opportunity to consider such a significant policy change; and calls on
    the Government to revise significantly downwards its proposed cap on the level
    of private income that can be generated by NHS hospitals.</p><p pid="a.536.1/3">It
    is a year this week since the Health and Social Care Bill was introduced in this
    House. Unlike the Government, we wanted to mark the anniversary, and having this
    Opposition debate seemed the right way to do it. It is happening because the Government
    have effectively sidelined this elected House from the debate about the future
    of the national health service. No single issue matters more to the people who
    put us all here, but what the future holds for the hospitals in our constituencies
    is no longer up to us. Instead, it is the unelected House that is right now carving
    up England&#8217;s NHS through back-room coalition deals. Ministers are making
    a series of desperate concessions in the other place to try to preserve the pitiful
    levels of support that remain for this unwanted and unnecessary Bill.</p><p pid="a.536.1/4">For
    the avoidance of doubt, let me summarise this scandalous situation. Here we have
    a Bill that nobody voted for. It was not in either the Tory or the Lib Dem manifestos,
    and it was ruled out specifically by the coalition agreement, yet it was rammed
    through this elected House so that the real decisions could be taken down the
    corridor in the unelected House. It is truly an affront to democracy that our
    nation&#8217;s most valued institution should be treated in this way. It thus
    falls to the Opposition to let this House take a view this evening on the far-reaching
    amendments to the Bill that are now being tabled, which Ministers were clearly
    too scared to table in this House.</p>

    class="" pid="b.709.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to provide that powers relating to energy generation in Wales be devolved
    to the National Assembly for Wales; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="b.709.2/3">The
    Welsh people are very protective of their natural resources. It was the UK Government&#8217;s
    decision in the 1960s to allow Liverpool Corporation to drown a Welsh valley and
    the Welsh-speaking village of Capel Celyn that led to my party, Plaid Cymru, winning
    the historic Carmarthen by-election in 1966. That seismic moment in the history
    of these isles also led to our Scottish sister party&#8217;s securing representation
    in the House, and the speeding up of the political dynamic that led to the creation
    of devolved Government and legislatures in Scotland and Wales.</p><p pid="b.709.2/4">We
    are living in historic times, and if the British state is to survive there needs
    to be a radical realignment that appeases the aspirations of the Celtic peoples
    of these islands to govern themselves and shape their own future. In the case
    of Scotland, it is probably too late.</p><p pid="b.709.2/5">Wales is an energy-rich
    nation. According to the Welsh Government, we have the potential to produce twice
    the electricity we require for our needs. According to the Department of Energy
    and Climate Change here in London, we are a net exporter of electricity. Yet in
    Wales, energy prices are among the highest in the British state, and we have some
    of the highest energy poverty levels. Clearly, something is going wrong somewhere.
    Unfortunately, some Unionist politicians seem happy to accept that unjust situation.</p><p
    pid="b.709.2/6">The topic of my maiden speech was fuel poverty. Having worked
    for the CAB movement before entering the House, I became acutely aware of the
    blight of fuel poverty on our communities. I remember doing a radio phone-in interview
    for the BBC, when somebody phoned in to explain that he depended on using a hairdryer
    to heat his flat during the winter. The fact that using such a device is more
    costly than orthodox heating methods misses the point. It shows the desperation
    that many households face in my country.</p><p pid="b.709.2/7">With, according
    to the campaign group National Energy Action Wales, a quarter of Welsh households
    in fuel poverty, we need radical solutions. I would like to put it on record that
    I am disappointed to read reports in the press this week that the Welsh Government
    have decided to scrap their fuel poverty advisory body, on which I once served.</p><p
    pid="b.709.2/8">Nobody in an energy-rich nation should suffer from fuel poverty
    so my party and I view control of our natural resources, energy-generation planning
    policy and energy policy as a whole as a key element of dealing with some of the
    major social justice issues we face.</p><p pid="b.709.2/9">Control over energy
    policy is also a key element of our vision of creating a new, dynamic economy
    for our country. Indeed, sustainable development is written into the constitution
    of Wales as a legislative country. We reject the vision of dependence and fiscal
    transfers from a self-serving London elite that some of our opponents</p><p pid="b.709.2/10">accept
    as an article of faith. We want a future for Wales in which we can stand on our
    own two feet and chart our own course in history.</p><p pid="b.709.2/11">Our natural
    resources offer huge opportunities for our country, but if those opportunities
    are to be realised, those resources need to be utilised in the interests of our
    country and our people. We cannot allow our natural resources to be pillaged for
    the benefit of others as our iron, coal and gold reserves were. This will be a
    major political dividing line for the future, and there are clear dangers for
    politicians who continue to treat Wales as a second-class nation.</p><p pid="b.709.2/12">Although
    responsibility for energy generating stations is completely devolved in Scotland
    and Northern Ireland, we in Wales have responsibility only for energy generation
    stations that generate up to a risible 50 MW. Where I come from politically, what
    is good enough for Northern Ireland and Scotland is good enough for Wales. We
    were given no reason in the debate I introduced last September why Wales had received
    such inferior status.</p><p pid="b.709.2/13">In the past 12 months, all three
    Unionist parties pledged in the National Assembly elections in Wales to increase
    the arbitrary 50 MW level to 100 MW for renewables. Is that progress? It is, but
    perhaps not at the speed I want. When given the opportunity to introduce that
    policy in the Localism Act 2011&#8212;schedule 13 to the Act, to be precise&#8212;the
    UK Government failed to do introduce the pledges of their Welsh branches.</p><p
    pid="b.709.2/14">I thank the hon. Members for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) and for
    Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) for supporting my Bill and for displaying
    consistency with the promises made to the people of Wales last year by their respective
    parties. I had hoped to amend the Act with a new clause, but alas it was not debated,
    so I am grateful for the opportunity to present this Bill.</p><p pid="b.709.2/15">There
    is no stronger message in Welsh politics than equality with Scotland and I look
    forward to using that battle cry in a different context after autumn 2014, certainly
    in respect of energy powers. The previous Welsh Government were in favour of increasing
    the limit to 100 MW, as are the Labour Government in Wales in relation to renewables.
    Civic and environmental organisations also support the policy&#8212;the Campaign
    for the Protection of Rural Wales and Friend of the Earth included it in their
    National Assembly manifestos.</p><p pid="b.709.2/16">The communities I represent
    in Carmarthen East and Dinefwr also support the policy. My constituency contains
    two of the seven strategic search areas earmarked for renewables developments
    in Wales in the Welsh Government&#8217;s 2005 technical advice note 8&#8212;TAN
    8&#8212;policy document. That was a crude exercise if the truth be told, with
    lines drawn on a map, mostly on Forestry Commission land, to earmark where onshore
    wind developments would henceforth be located.</p><p pid="b.709.2/17">The major
    problem is that developments above and below the 50 MW threshold are decided by
    different planning criteria. Those below the limit are processed by the local
    planning authority, which in this case is Carmarthenshire country council, and
    those above the limit are, for the next few months, the preserve of the Infrastructure
    Planning Commission. They will be the preserve of UK Government Ministers thereafter.</p><p
    pid="b.709.2/18">I am delighted that the UK Government scrapped the IPC in the
    Act. Indeed, scrapping that body was one of my major pledges during the last Westminster
    elections.</p><p pid="b.709.2/19">I am delighted that the coalition Government
    have delivered for me on that one, but the key question of where those powers
    should reside has left me and my constituents extremely disappointed. Instead
    of devolving the powers to Wales, the UK Government have retained them within
    the Department of Energy and Climate Change here in London, in the hands of Ministers
    far removed from the issues in the communities that I represent.</p><p pid="b.709.2/20">TAN
    8 area G is located in the Brechfa forest in north Carmarthenshire, an area that
    is world famous for its rally car stages. At least three major developments are
    to be located within the area. The first&#8212;the Alltwalis scheme&#8212;was
    below the 50 MW level. As a result of a string of problems associated with that
    development, my party&#8217;s councillors on the local authority have been presenting
    mitigating measures to improve the local planning authority&#8217;s policies to
    protect the communities of the affected area,. They include introducing a substantial
    buffer zone and operating conditions. This is called democracy&#8212;when local
    politicians react to the problems faced by those they serve.</p><p pid="b.709.2/21">However,
    the remaining developments are above the 50 MW level and will be determined by
    Ministers in London. The improvements to planning policy that we are working on
    in Carmarthenshire will not be adopted here. Development will be very much a free-for-all,
    with no protection for local residents. Indeed, in answer to a written question
    from me, the Secretary of State has not even bothered to visit the development
    in my constituency to gauge the concerns of those affected. That is clearly unsatisfactory.
    What faith can my constituents have in a system that gives them absolutely no
    control over developments on their doorstep? How can a system under which major
    planning decisions are taken by an alien Westminster Government, and not by democratic
    bodies in Wales, be just?</p><p pid="b.709.2/22">The Bill will mean the people
    of Wales gaining control over the Crown Estate in Wales so that the huge potential
    of tidal and wave power on the Welsh coastline is utilised as part of our energy
    strategy. Control over our energy resources matters because, without it, we are
    limited in what we can do to reach our potential as a country, to grow a new economy
    for Wales and to help the vulnerable.</p><p pid="b.709.2/23">I would like to finish
    by quoting that great Welsh political philosopher D. J. Williams, from Rhydcymerau,
    in my constituency. This is a translation, and I hope the great man will forgive
    me:</p><p pid="b.709.2/24">&#8220;It may be said that there is a divine right
    to anything on earth. The right over the land of Wales belongs to the Welsh nation,
    and no alien, whoever he be.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.709.2/25">Diolch yn fawr iawn.</p>

    class="" pid="b.183.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes with concern
    that the recent Bank of England publication, Trends in Lending, shows that net
    lending to businesses has fallen in nine out of the last 12 months and by more
    than &#163;10 billion in the last year; further notes that a Department for Business,
    Innovation and Skills report published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-02">2
    February 2012</phrase> states that the stock of lending to small and medium-sized
    enterprises peaked in 2009 and in November 2011 declined by 6.1 per cent. compared
    to November 2010, whilst banks were frequently setting bonuses for their senior
    executives which were too large; believes that bank executive remuneration should
    be related to performance and that banks either directly or indirectly supported
    by the taxpayer must recognise that the taxpayer expects very large bonuses only
    to be paid to reflect genuine exceptional performance; notes with concern that
    the Government has not given due consideration to repeating the bankers&#8217;
    bonus tax, in addition to the bank levy, to pay for 100,000 jobs for young people;
    calls on the Government to increase transparency, accountability and responsibility
    in the setting of pay in the banking sector, including through the immediate implementation
    of the Walker Review on corporate governance, and the placing of an employee representative
    on the remuneration committees of company boards; and further calls on the Government
    to reform the banking sector so that it better supports businesses and provides
    the credit they need to create jobs and growth.</p><p pid="b.183.2/3">I should
    like to take this opportunity to tell the House that I have been informed that
    the Business Secretary is not able to be here today because he is at a funeral.
    I am sure that the whole House will want to join me in wishing him well on this
    sad day.</p><p pid="b.183.2/4">The subject of the motion, responsibility and reform
    in the banking sector and in the wider economy, has been a matter of immense public
    interest of late and is one on which many Members have already spoken out. Let
    us be clear&#8212;I think I speak for most Members when I say this&#8212;that
    in speaking out on these issues hon. Members simply reflect the strong views expressed
    by our constituents on the subject.</p><p pid="b.183.2/5">The Labour party&#8217;s
    starting point is this: we are proud of our financial services centre, the City
    of London being arguably the world&#8217;s leading financial services centre.
    I, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357"
    name="Rachel Reeves">the Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves)</phrase>, the shadow
    Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who will make the Opposition&#8217;s winding-up
    speech, and many other Members are, I know, proud to have spent time working in
    the City of London before being elected to this place.</p><p pid="b.183.2/6">The
    City helps to give the country a competitive edge, thanks to the talent that we
    have here, our time zone, our company law, our jurisdiction and the free flow
    of capital in London. The financial services sector as a whole employs more than
    1 million people nationally and makes up 10% of our total national income, but
    no witness to recent history could claim with credibility that the sector has
    functioned as British businesses, our economy and our society as a whole would
    have wanted over the past few years.</p><p pid="b.183.2/7">Ultimately, the fault
    for that lies with a minority of those working in the sector, but as the party
    in government through much of that period we, along with others in</p><p pid="b.183.2/8">power
    throughout the world, must, and we do, accept with humility that we should have
    better regulated the sector, because dysfunction in the banking sector here and
    globally led to the financial crisis of 2008-09, to the recession that followed
    and to its aftermath. That recession, the gestation of which is found in the banking
    sector, is something for which the British people are still paying.</p>'

  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="b.946.4/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="b.946.4/2" pwmotiontext="yes">This
    is a bit like coming out in the play-off final after the brief half-time break
    at Wembley on Saturday. We just need a little bit more to close the deal as far
    as this Bill is concerned&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> It did
    not have to go to penalties.</p><p pid="b.946.4/3">We have had a lengthy and sometimes
    constructive debate during the Bill&#8217;s progress through the House, and it
    is worth taking stock now. The House has the opportunity to make a considerable
    game shift in the relationship between central and local government. We are now
    in a position to move away from what has been, on any independent view&#8212;as
    consistently endorsed by independent experts, going back to Layfield, the Lyons
    inquiry and the resource review&#8212;the unhealthy level of dependence of local
    government on central Government for income that has accrued over the years. As
    part of the Government&#8217;s localism agenda, we intend to hand back power to
    local people and the authorities that represent them. I hope that that principle
    will be recognised by hon. Members on both sides of the House.</p><p pid="b.946.4/4">I
    shall set out what the Bill does and its wider context as part of the coalition&#8217;s
    localism agenda. It is recognised that giving greater local control over expenditure
    and revenue raising is desirable. The principle of business rates retention is
    therefore supported across the House. Once we drill under some of the rhetoric,
    there is also a general recognition that welfare spending needs to be brought
    under control, and that it is right that local authorities should have control
    over council tax support.</p><p pid="b.946.4/5">The Bill incentivises local authorities
    to go for growth, because that is the other part of the agenda that the coalition
    regards as critical. We need to encourage sustainable growth and the Bill incentivises
    local authorities to grow their tax base by directly linking financial benefit
    to the decisions that they take on, for example, planning permissions that lead
    to more commercial floor space and economic activity, and in the design of their
    council tax support schemes that incentivise them to get claimants back into work,
    which is where we all want to see them wherever possible. It enables councils
    to decide how best to manage their contribution to reducing the deficit. All thoughtful
    commentators accept that a contribution must be made and that it is more likely
    to be nuanced and effectively delivered if there is local input into the design
    of that contribution.</p><p pid="b.946.4/6">Local authorities will also be given
    the freedom to decide how to help provide for the most vulnerable in their communities.
    I hope that no one seriously thinks that any party has a monopoly on concern for
    vulnerable people in their communities. The Government regard the vulnerable as
    a top priority, and that is why we have increased the weighting given to the needs
    element of the formula grant in our financial settlements; why we have maintained
    that in the baseline; why we introduced transition grants; and why we will ensure
    that local authorities that deal with some of those areas of greatest cost pressure
    in relation to adult social care and children&#8217;s care will be designated
    as top-up authorities and will have a degree of certainty about their funding
    by index-linking and protection from volatility. That is a practical commitment
    to helping to protect the most vulnerable in society.</p><p pid="b.946.4/7">The
    reforms are also part of our wider approach to supporting growth, which is our
    best hope of having the money that we need to support services for the vulnerable
    in a sustainable way; to get more people back into work; and to enable us to pay
    down the deficit, which at the moment ties the hands of central Government in
    seeking to deliver the services that we all want for our communities. We have
    made real progress on this front over the past two years. The Bill sets important
    incentives for business rate retention and helping people back into work through
    council tax support, but that is linked to other parts of the agenda. We are encouraging
    local authorities to build new homes, through the new homes bonus, an incentive
    for both commercial activity and domestic building. Homes as well as jobs are
    central to the incentives we are putting in place.</p><p pid="b.946.4/8">The local
    enterprise partnerships are bringing together businesses and civic leaders to
    provide strong local leadership and to drive growth. My right hon. Friend the
    Secretary of State, I and all the Ministers involved in the legislation very much
    hope that the Bill will not only make technical changes but bring about an attitude
    change in the relationship between local government and their business communities.
    Many of our competitors have a much closer relationship between their local authorities
    and the big economic drivers, but that has not always been incentivised in the
    UK. The Bill will enable it to happen and&#8212;I hope&#8212;help that mindset
    to develop. The LEPs will play a part in that by setting up the structure to enable
    it to happen.</p><p pid="b.946.4/9">We have put in place 24 enterprise zones offering
    discounted business rates and simplified planning to attract new local business
    and investment. The regional</p><p pid="b.946.4/10">growth fund, the Growing Places
    fund and the Get Britain Building fund are providing a &#163;3.3 billion boost
    to local economies and supporting tens of thousands of jobs, and through our welfare
    reforms we are seeking to bring welfare spending back under control and to target
    support. The 2010 spending review focused on reducing welfare costs through savings
    of about &#163;7 billion a year.</p><p pid="b.946.4/11">Localising council tax
    support will help to deliver savings of &#163;500 million across Great Britain&#8212;this
    in an area of activity where expenditure more than doubled under the Labour Government.
    It is not a sign of a healthy economy that expenditure on council tax benefit
    should have doubled between 1997 and 2009-10. Instead, we are providing strong
    incentives for local authorities to support growth and improve employment opportunities,
    helping to reduce poverty and reliance on support, as well as hold down costs
    in the long term. Speaking as someone whose grandfather clawed his way out of
    poverty in the east end, I, like plenty of other Government Members, have as much
    personal experience of such things as anyone else who has spoken.</p><p pid="b.946.4/12">The
    Bill has received extensive scrutiny. Its core principles were set out in the
    coalition agenda; we then proceeded with the local government resource review
    in early 2011; there was a consultation, along with eight detailed, technical
    papers to explain the thinking behind the reforms; and we have discussed the detail
    of the scheme through our local government finance working group and several sub-working
    groups. We have by no means ignored the views of local authorities; on the contrary,
    we have sought to engage with them, and will continue to do so, at every stage
    in the process. Those groups have been meeting frequently since January.</p><p
    pid="b.946.4/13">Localising council tax is a pragmatic approach to balancing the
    need for reform with ensuring a sensible level of deficit reduction, and builds
    on the welfare reform White Paper, published in autumn 2010, setting out our broad
    intentions. We undertook pre-consultation engagement with local authorities and
    other groups to help them to understand the issues, and held delivery partner
    engagement events last August and September, as well as a full three-month consultation
    from August to October that generated about 400 responses.</p><p pid="b.946.4/14">Against
    that background of consultation, nobody can say that the Government have not sought
    to engage with people over our reforms. Against that background of consultation
    and information sharing, last Thursday we published a series of statements of
    intent to provide clarity and assurance to the House and councils about how the
    reforms, including our proposal to fund localised support for council tax, will
    work in practice.</p><p pid="b.946.4/15">I shall tell the House what we have published
    so far and how much we have sought to set out the agenda. We have announced that
    business rates will be split 50:50 between central and local government and confirmed
    that central Government will return their share of business rates, in its entirety,
    to local government, and we have confirmed that the system will not be reset until
    2020 at the earliest to give sufficient reward and long-term certainty while ensuring
    that the scheme will be fiscally sustainable, thus protecting the interests of
    taxpayers and the wider economy.</p><p pid="b.946.4/16">Our economic analysis,
    which has been independently verified, suggests that a 50% local share over a
    seven-year reset could create an additional &#163;10 billion of gross domestic
    product. That figure is based on the multiplication</p><p pid="b.946.4/17">of
    additional commercial floor space created through our incentive effect and, then,
    the additional gross GDP that stems from the economic activity in that commercial
    floor space.</p><p pid="b.946.4/18">We have set out the statements of intent indicating
    what will be in the secondary legislation, including&#8212;as was noted in the
    previous debate&#8212;the safety net threshold, to be set at between 7.5% and
    10%, to protect against volatility.</p><p pid="b.946.4/19">On the localisation
    of council tax support, we have been clear that we will seek to provide as much
    detail as possible as early as possible. We continue to work with local authorities
    and service providers on the design of the scheme. <i>[</i> <i>Laughter.</i> <i>]</i>

    whilst affirming its support for a complete and accurate electoral register and
    a move to a system of individual electoral registration (IER), declines to give
    a Second Reading to the Electoral Registration and Administration Bill because
    whilst the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 received cross-party</p><p
    pid="c.1187.0/3">support, establishing an orderly move to IER with a strong independent
    role for the Electoral Commission in guarding against a sharp fall in registration
    numbers, the Bill speeds up the introduction of IER, and downgrades the Electoral
    Commission&#8217;s role, with the result that there will be no independent arbitrator
    with the power to halt the process if it is deemed to have resulted in a sharp
    drop in registration levels; notes that the 2015 parliamentary boundary changes
    will be based on the new electoral register which will potentially be inaccurate,
    risking illegitimate new constituency boundaries; believes the proposals would
    mean the young, the poor, ethnic minorities and disabled people would face an
    increased risk of being unregistered and thus excluded from a range of social
    and civic functions; further regards the proposals as flawed as they risk making
    the list from which juries are drawn less representative; concludes that because
    the evaluation of the second round of data-matching pilots will not be published
    until early 2013 an assessment of the likely completeness of the register is in
    effect prevented; and deplores the fact that the Government has not published
    secondary legislation and an implementation plan for the introduction of IER.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="c.1187.0/4">As the Minister has said, the Bill is essentially in two parts,
    the second of which concerns the minutiae of the administration and conduct of
    elections. Much of it contains relatively uncontentious proposals, but other matters
    ought to be addressed, particularly the need to ensure that there are no more
    queues at polling stations. One proposal might well raise a few eyebrows&#8212;to
    allow a candidate who is supported by two or more political parties to use the
    emblem of one of them. The Minister has said previously that the measure addresses
    an anomaly and permits Labour and Co-operative candidates to use those emblems.
    It is kind of him to be helpful to the Labour party, but I must tell Conservative
    Back Benchers to be afraid&#8212;be very afraid. It could well be the thin end
    of the wedge. Who knows what it could lead to?</p><p pid="c.1187.0/5">The first
    part of the Bill demands far greater attention because it focuses on electoral
    registration. The Opposition&#8217;s view is that individual electoral registration
    is a sound principle. It places an appropriate responsibility on individuals to
    register to vote and is in tune with modern society. It can no longer be sensible
    for voter registration to be in the hands of the head of household. Individual
    elector registration is also an effective way in which to ensure the completeness
    and accuracy of voter registration. That is why the Labour Government secured
    legislation for individual elector registration in Northern Ireland and Great
    Britain.</p><p pid="c.1187.0/6">Last autumn, the Government introduced their draft
    Bill and White Paper on IER. Understandably, their proposals at the time created
    consternation among a wide range of opinion. Much attention focused on their suggestion
    that there should be a virtual opt-out for individuals who do not wish to be reminded
    about registration by an electoral registration officer. The second proposal that
    understandably left many aghast was the suggestion in the White Paper that voter
    registration ought to be a lifestyle choice, and that no fines should be imposed
    for non-registration. I welcome the fact that the Government have reconsidered
    both those proposals and others, but we should be clear that a draft Bill and
    prior consultation are relatively innovative for this Government&#8212;there was
    no draft Bill or prior consultation on two previous pieces of important constitutional
    legislation, namely the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 and the Parliamentary
    Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011. I am glad that they are changing their
    ways. The opt-out has been dropped and civil penalties will be introduced, as
    suggested by the Opposition. I am also pleased that the Government have listened
    and that</p><p pid="c.1187.0/7">many electors on the old registers will be carried
    over. Similarly, the annual canvass planned in 2013 will now occur in 2014. As
    far as that is concerned, so far, so good.</p>

    class="" pid="c.231.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House recognises the need
    for defence reform; notes with concern the speed and depth of redundancies and
    the threat to historic regiments and battalions; supports the armed forces covenant
    but is anxious about the implications of changes to Service pensions and allowances
    and the effect of these and other measures on morale; further recognises the necessity
    of an advanced equipment programme but is worried about capability gaps, notably
    carrier strike; calls on the Government to end disadvantage and discrimination
    against the Service community in order to strengthen the covenant; and further
    calls on the Government to reassess the assumptions on which the Strategic Defence
    and Security Review was based.</p><p pid="c.231.1/3">Let me begin by acknowledging
    the courage and professionalism of our armed forces and recognising the invaluable
    support provided to them by their families. I know that that sentiment will be
    shared by all Members in the House. We ask servicemen and women to risk making
    the ultimate sacrifice, and to forgo many freedoms in the name of our national
    security. Their contribution to our safety must never be forgotten or underestimated.</p><p
    pid="c.231.1/4">Opposition Members recognise that our armed forces cannot be allowed
    to stand still. The combination of changing threats in an increasingly uncertain
    world with budgetary challenges means that we must be ahead of the curve in terms
    of technology and the tactics that we apply. We must be bold and practical in
    order to create an efficient fighting force which serves the primary requirement
    of our national security while also ensuring that we do the right thing on behalf
    of our servicemen and women and their families.</p><p pid="c.231.1/5">The major
    conflicts of recent history are drawing to a close. Meanwhile, a wave of popular
    uprisings throughout the middle east poses new challenges, as do new technologies
    and threats from cyber. Global changes will alter the balance of power, risk and
    how resources are allocated in the modern world. That is why Opposition Members
    support armed forces reform. Since May 2010, we have not opposed the Government
    simply for opposition&#8217;s sake. National security and support for our armed
    forces are worth more than cheap political point-scoring, although when we believe
    that the Government have made an error or strayed from their pre-election pledges,
    we will righty criticise and scrutinise their decisions.</p><p pid="c.231.1/6">We
    welcome the coalition&#8217;s commitment in 2010 to launch the security review.
    It built on the Green Paper published by the last Government, and our commitment
    in the last Parliament to undertake a defence review. Unfortunately, however,
    the one thing the coalition Government&#8217;s strategic defence and security
    review was not was strategic. The SDSR has unravelled quickly, displaying the
    same short-term, ad hoc and rushed decision making that is becoming characteristic
    of many areas of Government policy. The decisions that have been taken have left
    Britain with serious gaps in its defence capability. Events in the middle east
    last year&#8212;the Arab spring uprisings&#8212;were not foreseen, which meant
    the review was rendered out of date almost as soon as it had been printed. The
    Government were forced to use resources they had planned to scrap and bring back
    capability at very short notice.</p>

  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="a.382.1/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="a.382.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    thank Members from all parts of the House for their contributions to this debate.
    I speak not just as a Minister who is interested in the Bill, but as a business
    manager in saying that I am particularly gratified that we did not over-programme
    the Bill. We allowed the House the discretion to use the time sensibly, and it
    has done so responsibly. We have covered all the issues that are contained in
    the Bill and done them credit. I am grateful to Members from all parts of the
    House for that.</p><p pid="a.382.1/3">I believe that the electoral register is
    a key building block for our democracy. It is important that it is accurate and
    complete. I hope that my responses and those of the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet
    Office, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40263"
    name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper)</phrase> in Committee
    have answered all the concerns and questions that have been raised, and shown
    that the Bill will make the register more accurate and at least as complete as
    it is now. I hope that it will make it more complete.</p><p pid="a.382.1/4">On
    the conduct of the Bill&#8217;s passage, I thank hon. Members who have taken the
    time to write explanatory statements on the amendments that they tabled. That
    will have helped to ensure that the pilot is useful to the Procedure Committee
    in deciding whether to adopt the change in the longer term.</p><p pid="a.382.1/5">At
    the risk of this sounding like an Oscar acceptance speech, I also thank members
    of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee for scrutinising the legislation
    before it was introduced to the House. They did an excellent job. The Bill is
    much better for their comments and the care they took over their work. That would
    not have been the case were it not for the receptive interest shown by the Parliamentary
    Secretary, Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean, and the
    team of officials who supported him, in responding sensibly to the suggestions
    that were made. That shows the value that pre-legislative scrutiny can add to
    the development of legislation. The way in which the House has debated the Bill
    has shown that it has responded to that approach, and it has dealt with the Bill
    in a timely fashion.</p><p pid="a.382.1/6">I look forward to the debate continuing
    in another place. I reaffirm that it is the Government&#8217;s intention to publish
    further draft secondary legislation by the time Parliament returns in the autumn
    so that we have all the necessary tools to understand what is proposed as we take
    the Bill forward.</p><p pid="a.382.1/7">The Bill will tackle electoral fraud by
    speeding up the introduction of individual electoral registration, which will
    require electors to register individually, rather than by household. In moving
    to that system, individuals will have to provide information to verify their application.
    The Bill will modernise our electoral registration system, thereby facilitating
    the move to online registration, and make it more convenient for people to register
    to vote. Our aim is to take steps to tackle electoral fraud, increase the number
    of people who are registered to vote and improve the integrity of the register.
    The safeguards that the Bill puts in place, such as the use of data matching to
    confirm and automatically retain about two thirds of electors on the register,
    the moving of the 2013 canvass to early 2014, and the introduction of a civil
    penalty for those who fail to make an application when required to do so, will
    help us to achieve that aim. As we have debated today, the Bill also includes
    provisions to improve the administration and conduct of elections, which will
    serve to increase voter participation and make a number of improvements to the
    running of elections.</p><p pid="a.382.1/8">That we have elections based on the
    highest integrity, with registers that are as complete and accurate as possible,
    is the bedrock of our democratic system. It is incumbent on all hon. Members to
    make that a reality, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

    gap between Ministers&#8217; statements and what is happening in the NHS; notes
    mounting evidence of rationing of treatments and services by cost, despite Ministers&#8217;
    claims to have prevented it; further regrets the increasing number of cost-driven
    reconfigurations of hospital services, despite the Coalition Agreement&#8217;s
    promise of a moratorium on changes to hospital services; further notes growing
    private sector involvement in both the commissioning and provision of NHS services,
    contradicting Ministers&#8217; claims that the NHS reorganisation would not increase
    levels of privatisation; recognises that, according to the Government&#8217;s
    Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses figures, actual Government spending on
    the NHS in 2011-12 fell by &#163;26 million, the second successive real-terms
    reduction in NHS spending, following a reduction of &#163;766 million in the Government&#8217;s
    first year in office, in breach of the commitment in the Coalition Agreement;
    believes the Government&#8217;s decision to reorganise the NHS has distracted
    its focus from the financial challenge, with seven out of 10 acute hospital trusts
    in England missing savings targets in the first half of 2011-12; calls on the
    Government to take action to prevent rationing by cost in the NHS, based on the
    evidence presented; and further calls on the Government to honour pledges on NHS
    spending in the Coalition Agreement, and the commitment that future savings will
    be reinvested into the NHS front line, and to return at least half of the underspend
    to the Department of Health budget.</p><p pid="d.710.2/3">The year 2011 was the
    first full year of the coalition Government and the year of the biggest ever fall
    in public satisfaction with the national health service. As I shall set out, those
    two facts are not unconnected. The NHS in England is reeling from the Government&#8217;s
    catastrophic decision to reorganise it at a time of huge financial pressure. Warnings
    by Opposition Members and others during the passage of the Health and Social Care
    Act 2012 of a postcode lottery, of destabilised hospitals and of increasing privatisation
    are, sadly, beginning to materialise.</p><p pid="d.710.2/4">For the coalition,
    attention has moved to other battles&#8212;more pressing priorities&#8212;but
    for the NHS the moment of greatest danger is now, as the unstoppable force of
    reorganisation hits the immovable object of the financial challenge. That is why
    the Opposition make no apology for introducing this debate, or for bringing the
    House&#8217;s attention back to where it should be: our country&#8217;s most important
    public service and the struggle it faces.</p><p pid="d.710.2/5">I am grateful

    but there need be no disagreement in the House today. I hope that all right hon.
    and hon. Members, including Ministers, will feel able to support the motion in
    the Lobby later this afternoon. It is a straightforward motion with a simple proposition&#8212;that
    the rising cost of rail travel is now adding to the financial pressures facing
    many households. That is a fact, and I would hope that we will see agreement at
    least on that. It is something that we are all hearing from our constituents.
    I also hope that we can agree on a second basic proposition&#8212;that the level
    by which rail fares increase should not simply be left to the private train companies
    to determine. It is why we have the system of regulated and unregulated fares,
    with those tickets on which most people rely, including day returns and season
    tickets, having their annual increase capped.</p><p pid="b.244.2/6">There has
    always been cross-party agreement that there is a role for Government in the setting
    of fare levels and it is right that we retain the ability to protect our constituents
    from a profit-driven free-for-all on fare rises. The reality, however, is that
    the so-called cap on annual fare rises, even for regulated fares, is not a cap
    at all. So when the Chancellor stands up, as he does, and says that fares will
    not rise by more than 1% above inflation&#8212;or whatever percentage it might
    be&#8212;he cannot</p><p pid="b.244.2/7">actually deliver that commitment at ticket
    offices across the country, because the cap is an average and train companies
    have the flexibility, as they like to call it, to increase fares by up to 5% above
    the so-called cap.</p><p pid="b.244.2/8">In January, just two months after the
    Chancellor had promised a 1% above-inflation cap on fare rises, what did commuters
    find when they went to buy their tickets? They found fare rises not of 1% above
    inflation but of up to 11% above inflation, because the train companies had exercised
    their flexibility to add up to another 5% on to some fares. That is what our constituents
    across the country face again in the coming new year&#8212;fare rises of up to
    11%. We are kidding ourselves, therefore, if we think that what we are debating
    is whether the cap should be RPI plus 1 or RPI plus 3, because the train companies
    can game it to their advantage. That is why our motion proposes that if we are
    to have a cap on regulated fare rises&#8212;we believe that there should be one,
    and I think the Government do too&#8212;it should be a real cap.</p>

    class="" pid="b.203.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes with concern
    that September 2012 marks the first term where students will face the trebling
    of student fees to &#163;9,000 a year; further notes that barriers are also being
    put up for vocational routes, with direct Government support for learners cut
    for level 3 courses and above, which includes apprenticeships and access courses
    to university, and with Higher Education-style loans being introduced, costing
    learners up to &#163;4,000 a year; and calls on the Government to change course
    and, as a first step, reduce tuition fees to &#163;6,000, funded by reversing
    the corporation tax cut for banks and requiring graduates earning over &#163;65,000
    a year to pay higher interest rates on their student loans.</p><p pid="b.203.2/3">In
    just over a week, university freshers weeks will kick off in earnest ahead of
    the new academic year. New students will soon start arriving at their institutions
    excited, nervous and full of anticipation and hope for their futures as they look
    forward to three, maybe four, of the best years of their life. They do so against
    a backdrop of confidence in the quality of our world-class higher education sector,
    which collectively will do all it can to give them the best possible higher education
    experience.</p><p pid="b.203.2/4">But this year is also markedly different, for
    this year we will see the first cohort of students who as a result of the Government&#8217;s
    action will be paying tuition fees of up to &#163;9,000 a year and leaving university
    with significant debts which for some will exceed &#163;50,000. Until the Government
    changed the rules of the game, higher education had been paid for by a partnership
    between the student and taxpayer since 1998, but this Government&#8217;s trebling
    of tuition fees in conjunction with their 80% cut in the teaching grant for universities
    represents a betrayal of future generations of students.</p><p pid="b.203.2/5">The
    partnership model for funding has been torn up, and students have been told to
    go it alone. They must bear the burden of the cost entirely on their own. We all
    know that this is not what the Liberal Democrats said they would do before the
    general election.</p>

  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="a.321.5/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the clause be read a Second time.</p><p class="" pid="a.321.5/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    have already welcomed both new Ministers to their places while in a Committee,
    but I shall repeat the exercise because it is welcome to see them both on the
    Front Bench today. The spirit of consensus that was started on Second Reading
    ran into some thick treacle in the Public Bill Committee, but perhaps a fresh
    approach with a fresh set of Ministers will allow us to return to those heady
    days.</p><p pid="a.321.5/3">I make no apology for bringing the new clause to the
    attention of the House. It was tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40295" name="Andy Slaughter">the Member for Hammersmith
    (Mr Slaughter)</phrase> in Committee only for us to run out of time to have a
    proper debate and a proper Government response. It is important that right hon.
    and hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber understand the situation and the
    context in which we propose the new clause.</p><p pid="a.321.5/4">If I use the
    term &#8220;CFAs&#8221;, I hope everyone knows that I am referring to conditional
    fee agreements. I will also refer to after-the-event insurance, and I might slip
    into calling them ATEs. Some extremely knowledgeable Members will have no problem
    understanding CFAs, ATEs and various other acronyms, but I hope the House in general
    will be clear what I mean if I use them.</p><p pid="a.321.5/5">Conditional fee
    agreements, also known as no win, no fee agreements, were first made possible
    in personal injury cases by secondary legislation under the Courts and Legal Services
    Act 1990 and were introduced in</p><p pid="a.321.5/6">1995. They were meant to
    provide greater access to justice for those who did not qualify for legal aid
    but were unable to afford legal representation. Defamation cases were never covered
    by legal aid.</p><p pid="a.321.5/7">From 1995 until April 2000, there was limited
    take-up of CFAs, as some of the costs were still borne by the claimant. The Access
    to Justice Act 1999, which came into effect in 2000, introduced significant changes
    and reduced the scope of legal aid, particularly for personal injury, on the basis
    that those cases could now rely on CFAs. At the same time, the 1999 Act made CFAs
    more usable by allowing the recoverability of the success fee and the after-the-event
    insurance premium. It therefore became possible for people to take legal action
    without the fear of losing everything because of significant cost implications,
    although it was still necessary, of course, to find a lawyer willing to take the
    case because, if they lost, the lawyer would lose his or her fee. That is an important
    point at which to pause for consideration, as lawyers would therefore prefer to
    take on only those cases that they believed they could win.</p><p pid="a.321.5/8">Just
    so we are clear, damages awarded to claimants in defamation cases are typically
    between &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000, whereas the costs of such litigation frequently
    run to many hundreds of thousands of pounds, but the Government now seem to think
    that the fees lawyers charge will come down if fewer people can get access to
    justice. Two situations could arise&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i>
    Before I explain them, let me welcome the Secretary of State, who has just taken
    his place on the Treasury Bench.</p><p pid="a.321.5/9">Let us consider a situation
    in which a person feels that they have been defamed, perhaps by the media, as
    is too often the case and as happened in the horrendous and tragic case we heard
    about earlier. The claimant would currently be able to agree a no win, no fee
    agreement, and if the person won, he or she would keep their damages and the lawyer
    would be entitled to get a success fee of between 10% and 100% depending on the
    conduct of the case. The insurance premium could also be recovered. The cumulative
    effect of the cases that lawyers win helps them to offset the costs of the cases
    that they lose. If the claimant loses, the insurers will pay the other side&#8217;s
    costs.</p><p pid="a.321.5/10">Let me give some examples of ordinary people who
    have been libelled or intruded on by the media and would otherwise not have been
    able to afford legal representation. Robert Murat was grossly defamed after the
    disappearance of Madeleine McCann and won significant damages from almost a dozen
    news outlets. He was supported by the use of a CFA. We all know that Christopher
    Jefferies was &#8220;monstered&#8221; by the press after he was arrested for questioning
    by the police in the Joanna Yeates murder trial, despite the fact that Jefferies
    was released after two days without charge. It is difficult to see how he could
    have received fair redress without the use of a CFA.</p>

    the view that the agreement on the fiscal compact was unlawful, but in reality
    nothing has been done&#8212;hence my call for the legal reserve on this matter,
    although the legal reserve issued before has never been implemented.</p><p pid="b.815.4/11">The
    Government know that the proposals referred to in the second part of my amendment
    are unlawful. The Council of Ministers&#8217; own legal adviser, in a lengthy
    opinion which I have seen and which the Government cannot dispute, states that
    there will have to be an amendment to the treaties if the powers of the governing
    council of the ECB are to be delegated to the single supervisory mechanism.</p><p
    pid="b.815.4/12">The legal opinion says on the proposal amending the EBA regulation,
    in effect, that in terms of the EBA&#8217;s dispute resolution powers there is
    no justification for treating the ECB differently from banking authorities in
    non-eurozone member states by exempting it from those powers. To do so would be
    a clear breach of the principle in law of non-discrimination.</p><p pid="b.815.4/13">As
    to the proposal giving the ECB prudential oversight of credit institutions in
    the eurozone, the legal opinion states that in establishing the single supervisory
    mechanism the council must respect the legal framework for decision making within
    the ECB set by primary law&#8212;that is, the treaties. This framework does not
    allow the ECB&#8217;s governing council to delegate decision-making functions
    on banking supervision to a subsidiary body such as the SSM. There is nothing
    in the legal base for the SSM proposal, in article 127(6) of the treaty on the
    functioning of the European Union, which would permit secondary law&#8212;that
    is, this draft regulation&#8212;amending the rules laid down in primary law. There
    is no question about it and the Government know that.</p><p pid="b.815.4/14">Non-eurozone
    member states are not entitled to participate in the ECB&#8217;s decision making,
    so they can have no formal decision-making role in the SSM as conceived. Furthermore,
    the law on banking supervision in the EU will be made up of directives to a significant
    extent. This is a requirement of the treaties. That means that the ECB cannot
    propose one-size-fits-all legislation on banking union. Rather, it can propose
    legislation which allows for differences in national transposition.</p><p pid="b.815.4/15">We
    simply cannot countenance a situation in which there is a wilful breach of the
    rule of law and where the dysfunctional European Union vaunts the rule of law,
    yet deliberately breaks its own rules. This is precisely what led to the kind
    of constitutional crisis that we have seen in our own history when Governments
    from the Stuarts onwards claimed a divine right to rule but then broke the common
    law. This is the primrose path to constitutional disaster not only for the United
    Kingdom, but for Europe as a whole. I hope the House will understand my concern,
    as I suggested back in the 1990s that this would happen.</p><p pid="b.815.4/16">I
    hear what the Minister says but I cannot understand why and how, given comments
    that I have received from the City of which I am sure he is aware. Those in the
    City make it clear that the single market would be put at risk by an imperfect
    single market in financial services in which rules differed by level of membership
    of the EU. Furthermore, they say:</p><p pid="b.815.4/17">&#8220;It is essential
    that voting arrangements within the European Banking Authority are clarified so
    as to avoid members of the Banking Union voting together en bloc and imposing
    financial regulation on non-Eurozone members through qualified majority.&#8221;</p><p

    an average of &#163;107,500 from the Government&#8217;s decision to cut the top
    rate of income tax from April 2013; further notes that figures from the Institute

    for pensioners will mean that 4.4 million existing pensioners will lose an average
    of &#163;83 from 2013-14, while thousands of people turning 65 will lose &#163;323;

    average, &#163;107,000 for those earning more than &#163;1 million a year. It
    was the moment that the Government&#8217;s fa&#231;ade of fairness disappeared
    for good. In these tough times, against the backdrop of the biggest squeeze in
    living standards for a generation, and with the economy flatlining, the Chancellor

    over two in every hundred people referred to the Work Programme in its first year
    have gone into work; further notes that it has delivered a worse outcome than
    no programme at all; recognises that long term unemployment is soaring and that
    the welfare bill is projected to be &#163;20 billion higher than planned; notes
    with concern that the Government is cutting &#163;14 billion from tax credits
    and is taking &#163;6.7 billion from disability benefits to pay for this cost
    of failures; and calls on the Government to implement a bank bonus tax to fund
    a Real Jobs Guarantee for young people and commission a cumulative impact assessment
    of disability benefit changes.</p><p pid="b.292.1/3">Our debate takes place in
    the shadow of the Chancellor&#8217;s winter statement next week. It is clear that
    a winter of misery lies ahead. The Chancellor has already had to revise up the
    cost of welfare spending for this Parliament by an eye-watering &#163;20 billion,
    and now, after yesterday&#8217;s brutal exposure of the Work programme, we know
    a great deal more about who is to blame.</p><p pid="b.292.1/4">We already knew
    that the Chancellor had done his level best to throttle the recovery. He has cut
    so far and so fast that we have now been landed with the longest double-dip recession
    since the war; and our economy is so fragile that the Governor of the Bank of
    England has warned that we might lapse into another recession this year; but what
    we did not know until yesterday was just how badly let down the Chancellor, the
    Cabinet and our constituents have been by the complete inability of the Department
    for Work and Pensions to get our country back to work. No wonder the Chancellor
    is tearing strips off the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in Cabinet.</p><p
    pid="b.292.1/5">All over Britain, businesses and families are busting a gut to
    do anything and everything to find work. Some 60% of jobs created since the election
    have either been part-time or self-employed, and, amidst all that strain and effort,
    we might have expected a little more support and a little more of a helping hand
    from the DWP. Yesterday, however, we discovered that it has done worse than nothing.
    Ministers swept into office promising the biggest-ever scheme to help people back
    to work, but yesterday we heard, not the hype, but the reality. It has been trying
    to hide these figures for more than a year, and yesterday we found out why: the
    Work programme has proved precisely as useful as doing absolutely nothing&#8212;in
    fact, worse than nothing.</p><p pid="b.292.1/6">When the DWP went out to market
    to ask contractors to come forward and help with the task, it said, in its documents,
    that it could expect about 5% of people on long-term benefits to make it into
    work under their own steam each year. That is why it set itself a target of outperforming
    doing nothing by 10%&#8212;not a high bar&#8212;but somehow it managed to set
    a target as low as possible and miss it. It is right, therefore, that the House
    highlights, not just this failure, but the soaring cost of failure, which our
    constituents will now have to help pay down.</p>'

  question: Question put (Standing Order No. 23).
  tidied_motion:
  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="a.728.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="" pid="a.728.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to repeal the Human Rights Act 1998; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="a.728.2/3">The
    Human Rights Act 1998 gives effect in UK law to the rights and freedoms under
    the European convention on human rights and makes available in UK courts a remedy
    for breach of a convention right. Under section 2 of the Act, a court or tribunal
    in the UK determining a question that has arisen in connection with a convention
    right must take into account any judgment, decision, declaration or advisory opinion
    of the European Court of Human Rights. Under section 3, primary and subordinate
    legislation must, so far as it is possible to do so, be read and given effect
    in a way that is compatible with the convention rights. This applies to any primary
    and subordinate legislation whenever it was enacted.</p><p pid="a.728.2/4">Section
    3 also states that this provision does not affect the validity of any incompatible
    legislation, although it is also true under section 6 that it is unlawful for
    a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with a convention right.
    As we have seen, the view of successive Governments over the years has been that
    when a UK law is found to be incompatible with the European convention, it is
    the UK law that gives way to secure compliance with the convention.</p><p pid="a.728.2/5">Indeed,
    the Human Rights Act conveniently supplies a fast-track procedure to facilitate
    this happening quickly. Under section 10, a Minister of the Crown may make such
    amendments to primary legislation as are considered necessary to enable the incompatibility
    to be removed by the simple expedient of making an order. In effect, because the
    accepted practice is that the United Kingdom observes its international obligations,
    a supranational court can impose its will against ours. In my view this is fundamentally
    undemocratic.</p><p pid="a.728.2/6">However, there is no point in belonging to
    a club if one is not prepared to obey its rules. The solution is therefore not
    to defy judgments of the Court, but rather to remove the power of the Court over
    us. The fundamental point is that one cannot alter the political nature of a decision
    by changing the location where the decision is made. Judges do not have access
    to a tablet of stone not available to the rest of us which enables them to discern
    what our people need better than we can possibly do as their elected, fallible,
    corrigible representatives. There is no set of values that are so universally
    agreed that we can appeal to them as a useful final arbiter. In the end they will
    always be shown up as either uselessly vague or controversially specific. Questions
    of major social policy, whether on abortion, capital punishment, the right to
    bear firearms or workers rights, should ultimately be decided by elected representatives
    and not by unelected judges.</p><p pid="a.728.2/7">Let us take the recent example
    of prisoner voting. The view of the Court is that, although the Council of Europe
    member states have a margin of appreciation in deciding how far prisoners should
    be enfranchised, a complete ban on voting was outside that margin. The fact that
    we do not have a blanket ban on prisoners</p><p pid="a.728.2/8">voting does not
    seem to have troubled the Court, even though the Attorney-General went out of
    his way to point this out in person when he appeared before the Court. There are
    several categories of prisoner who have the vote now&#8212;prisoners who are on
    remand, prisoners who are sentenced but not convicted, and prisoners who are in
    prison for defaulting on fines. But the Court is in effect saying, &#8220;Sorry,
    we don&#8217;t like your arrangements. We prefer ours.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.728.2/9">Although
    I personally object to the idea of prisoners having the vote, my much more fundamental
    objection is to the idea that a court sitting overseas, composed of judges from
    among other countries Latvia, Liechtenstein and Azerbaijan, however fine they
    may be as people, should have more say over what laws should apply in the United
    Kingdom than our constituents do through their elected Members of Parliament.
    Some may say that that is what the UK signed up to, to which I would only reply,
    &#8220;Precisely.&#8221; That is why we need to repeal the Human Rights Act and
    resile from the convention.</p><p pid="a.728.2/10">The idea that that would make
    us a pariah state is simply nonsense. For example, Canada is a member of the Organisation
    of American States, the equivalent of the Council of Europe for the Americas,
    but has not signed up to the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court, without
    becoming in any sense a pariah state.</p><p pid="a.728.2/11">Some might say that
    that would raise all kinds of other legal problems, that everything from the United
    Nations convention against torture to the Good Friday agreement is predicated
    upon our membership of the European convention so that it would be impossibly
    difficult to change things. I do not find that persuasive. It was not that many
    years ago that people said that a Bill of Rights of any kind would be impossible
    in the United Kingdom because of parliamentary sovereignty. The truth is that
    if one wants to do something badly enough, one can find a way to do it, and to
    do it legally&#8212;that is precisely what one keeps clever lawyers for. Goodness,
    if one wants something badly enough, it turns out one can even go to war in defiance
    of both world opinion and international law and find a lawyer to say that it is
    perfectly lawful.</p><p pid="a.728.2/12">I particularly commend the second Kingsland
    memorial lecture, given by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40047"
    name="Nick Herbert">the Member for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert)</phrase>,
    who is a sponsor of the Bill, in which he set out the argument at much greater
    length. His central point, with which I agree, is that on prisoner voting, as
    on so much else, we should not defy the ECHR, but resile from it altogether.</p><p
    pid="a.728.2/13">I will end by reflecting on the comment of Judge Learned Hand:</p><p
    pid="a.728.2/14">&#8220;I often wonder whether we do not rest our hopes too much
    upon constitutions, upon laws and upon courts. These are false hopes; believe
    me, these are false hopes. Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it
    dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no constitution, no
    law, no court can even do much to help it&#8230; What is this liberty that must
    lie in the hearts of men and women? It is not the ruthless, the unbridled will;
    it is not the freedom to do as one likes. That is the denial of liberty and leads
    straight to its overthrow. A society in which men recognize no check on their
    freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage
    few&#8221;.</p><p pid="a.728.2/15">In my view, our best check is not unelected
    judges, but the spirit of liberty in the hearts of the elected representatives
    in this House. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

    Bill is about the coalition&#8217;s priority: promoting economic growth. It contains
    a range of practical measures to boost infrastructure, increase housing supply
    and simplify planning rules, and all those things will make a difference now.
    I am grateful to the House for acting so swiftly in considering the Bill and I
    thank all colleagues who have contributed today, in Committee and on Second Reading.

    who shouldered most of the burden, and the Opposition for ensuring that, although
    we did not come to agreement on all the main issues, they were at least properly
    ventilated and discussed.</p><p pid="a.661.0/3">As amended, the Bill will provide
    for commencement on Royal Assent for clauses that support stalled sites being
    unblocked, broadband being rolled out, the removal of legislative blocks on the
    gas innovation network competition, and broadening the major infrastructure regime&#8212;key
    reforms to promote growth, on which the Government are acting decisively. It is
    regrettable that the Labour party stands alone in failing to appreciate the urgency
    of the Bill and continuing to oppose it.</p>'

    we first consulted on the Bill and during its passage through the House of Lords,
    it has aroused quite a bit of passion and debate among those interested in the
    subject. The first aim of my speech will be to try to satisfy the House that most
    of the passion and debate turns on the very important detail of the way in which
    the Bill&#8217;s processes will work. No doubt, the detail will be considered
    at great length in Committee rather than today. I believe that I can demonstrate
    that there is no real division on principle between the Government and most of
    the people who have debated this matter. The Government are just as committed
    as any other Member of either House of Parliament to the principles of justice
    being done in civil cases, the rule of law and the accountability of our intelligence
    agencies both to the courts and to Parliament. I believe that accountability will
    be improved by the Bill.</p><p pid="b.713.2/3">Our intelligence services comprise
    brave men and women, and we all realise they do essential work in helping to protect
    us against the great threats to this country. We also insist that they should
    respect and follow our values when carrying out their work, and they are properly
    accountable to the law and Parliament. I think the best people in the intelligence
    agencies are anxious to be able to demonstrate that, to protect their reputation
    and taxpayers&#8217; money for claims made against them.</p>

    know whether his decision was made in an attempt to stave off an embarrassing
    rebellion in this debate, whether the response to his call for evidence finally
    convinced him that the game was up, or whether he simply reflected that the Labour
    party, the industry and&#8212;let us be honest&#8212;just about everybody has
    been right all along. However, if this chance is seized, maybe no one will really

    cost of transport is adding to the financial pressures facing many households;
    notes that the Government failed to honour its pledge to cap this month&#8217;s
    rail fare rises at 1 per cent above inflation, resulting in some fares rising
    by as much as 9.2 per cent; recognises that this was a direct consequence of the
    Government&#8217;s decision to give back to the private train operators the right
    to increase fares by up to an additional 5 per cent beyond the increase set by
    Ministers; further notes that bus fares increased on average by more than twice
    the rate of inflation in 2012; calls on the Government to ban train operators
    from increasing fares beyond strict limits and to rule out the proposed introduction
    of a new category of super peak ticket which would increase the burden on hard-pressed
    commuters; and further calls on Ministers to support transport authorities pursuing
    Quality Contracts to bring accountability to bus fares, instead of using Better
    Bus Area funding to penalise authorities seeking to get better value for money
    for these taxpayer-funded services.</p><p pid="b.393.1/3">I begin by thanking

    rising by more than the rate of inflation&#8212;by much more in many cases. That

    who just do not seem to understand the pain they are imposing on hard-working
    people. Returning to work after the new year, those who commute by rail found
    that the price of their tickets had increased by an average of 4.2%, and by as
    much as 9.2% on some routes. Over the past year, bus fares have increased by more
    than twice the rate of inflation and motorists have found that VAT at 20% wipes
    out any relief they have had from the deferral of increases in fuel duty. Yet
    most people are not seeing their wages go up by anything like as much as those
    increases, and for many their wages or salaries are stagnant or falling.</p>

    Bill moves into its Third Reading with&#8212;I believe&#8212;its fundamental principles
    intact. I thought that my hon. Friend the Minister of State&#8217;s closing speech
    before the votes answered, in detail, many of the questions that remained after
    the debate on the amendments, but now, on Third Reading, I think it important
    to make further progress.</p><p pid="a.128.3/3">The arguments that we advanced
    when we presented the Bill were first and foremost about affordability. Our main
    argument concerned the need to reduce the historic deficit left by Labour. As
    I have said to my colleagues throughout the coalition, at no stage have we made
    our decisions lightly. This is not something that, at the start, we would have
    wanted to do, and I want to come back to that point in a moment. We were left
    a legacy of disaster and spending that was out of control, and our priority must
    be to get that back under control. If we do not do that, the poorest in society
    will fare the worst&#8212;that is the main point to make.</p><p pid="a.128.3/4">Let
    me give an illustration of the point I was making. Under the previous Government
    public spending ran to excess, while the cost of working age welfare increased
    by some 60% in real terms, as has been said on a number of occasions. Money was
    poured into what became an over-inflated system; as my hon. Friend the Minister
    of State, has said, for every &#163;3 taken in tax &#163;4 was actually borrowed,
    with the result that we had a growing deficit. It was one of the worst deficits
    in Europe, if not the worst in the western world. We spent &#163;170 billion on
    tax credits alone between 2003 and 2010. For all the talk about this being absolutely
    about people in work, 70% of that money went on child tax</p><p pid="a.128.3/5">credits,
    chasing a target that Labour never hit, and that was payable regardless of whether
    parents were in work or not.</p>

    rented sector&#8217;s growing role in meeting housing need; notes that there are
    8.5 million people, including more than one million families with children, now
    renting privately; recognises there are major implications of the growth in this
    tenure for families and communities in Britain today; notes with concern the lack
    of protection afforded to tenants and landlords by the unregulated lettings market
    and the confusing, inconsistent fees and charges charged by letting and management
    agents; further notes the lack of stability, security and affordability for families
    and other renters; further notes the increasing number of complaints about rogue
    landlords and the poor standards in the sector compared with other tenures; calls
    on the Government to regulate residential lettings and management agents and to
    end the confusing, inconsistent charges regime, making fees easily understandable,
    upfront and comparable across agents; further calls on the Government to promote
    longer term tenancies where tenants want them; and finally calls on the Government
    to introduce a national register of landlords and empower local authorities to
    improve standards and deal with rogue landlords.</p><p pid="a.378.2/3">The question
    for debate today is simple: how do we ensure that the private rented sector provides
    enough homes that are sufficiently stable and secure, affordable and of a decent
    standard? Nearly 8.5 million people, including more than 1 million families with
    children, now rent privately. Labour believes that the private rented sector has
    an important role to play in meeting housing need. As a result of the biggest
    housing crisis in a generation, more and more people are being locked out of home
    ownership and are looking to find their homes in the private rented sector.</p><p
    pid="a.378.2/4">The housing crisis gets worse by the day. House building is down;
    new starts are down 9% in the past year alone to fewer than 100,000. Homelessness
    is up, having risen by more than a third since the general election. People struggle
    to get mortgages and rents are ever rising in the private rented sector.</p><p
    pid="a.378.2/5">Most people dream of owning their own homes and we want them to
    realise their dream&#8212;as we did in government, when more than 1 million more
    families were able to buy their own homes. However, more people are finding themselves
    in the private rented sector, and for longer periods than at any time in years
    gone by.</p><p pid="a.378.2/6">We want a strong and thriving private rented sector
    that works for all those people, but the evidence shows that too many tenants
    are being ripped off by unscrupulous letting agents, lack security in their homes,
    face ever-increasing and unpredictable rents, and are plagued by rogue landlords
    and poor standards. We need a private rented sector that protects tenants and
    landlords from being ripped off by unscrupulous letting agents who do not protect
    their money and are not clear about the fees that they charge.</p>'

    was demoted and had my salary cut by 40 per cent, all because I said on my personal

    I wrote those four words using my own computer, outside work time, on a page that
    was not visible to the general public. Yet my bosses at work still saw fit to
    punish me.</p><p pid="b.799.2/5">I tried reasoning with my bosses, but they dug
    their heels in. I was left with no option but to go to court to clear my name.
    It took the better part of two years, which was a living nightmare for my family
    and me. In November the High Court ruled in my favour. But they didn&#8217;t have
    the power to order my reinstatement so I was left in a demoted job which carried
    a lower salary. I have now found a job with a different employer. I shouldn&#8217;t
    have been treated like an outcast, and my family shouldn&#8217;t have had to suffer
    like they did.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.799.2/6">I am introducing this Bill to protect
    people like Adrian Smith. His case cost him and the charity that supported him
    &#163;30,000. He got &#163;98 in damages. He was told by the lawyers who advised
    him that he would be unlikely to win his case for unfair dismissal because of
    recent rulings by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p><p pid="b.799.2/7">One
    of those rulings went against Lillian Ladele. She was told by the European Court
    of Human Rights that she had no right to have her view on marriage respected at
    work. She was dismissed by Islington borough council, even though the relevant
    part of her work could easily have been given to other employees. That ruling
    means that an employee who is ordered to go against their conscience on the issue
    of marriage has few, if any, legal rights to protect them. That is why we need
    an amendment to the Equality Act 2010.</p><p pid="b.799.2/8">There is already
    a problem, but if the Government succeed in redefining marriage, the problem will
    get much worse. We are told that the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill is to be
    fast-tracked and that full scrutiny on the Floor of the House is not welcome.
    However, the Bill is not some obscure change in the law; it raises profound ethical,
    moral and, I would argue, constitutional matters that affect the Church of England.
    It also raises matters of conscience. We therefore need full scrutiny on the Floor
    of the House. I hope that the Opposition will press for that. I, for one, will
    support them if they do.</p><p pid="b.799.2/9">I have this opportunity, a week
    before the Second Reading of that Bill, to put on the record the deep concern
    that exists about freedom of conscience. I believe that that right is as important
    as the protection of church weddings. The Government&#8217;s Bill does nothing
    to protect ordinary people&#8217;s conscientious views. Adrian</p><p pid="b.799.2/10">Smith
    and Lillian Ladele can therefore be mistreated at work. They should be protected,
    but the Bill offers them no protection.</p><p pid="b.799.2/11">Aidan O&#8217;Neill
    QC has produced a legal opinion that points out that NHS and Army chaplains may
    argue their case for traditional marriage in church on a Sunday, but could find
    themselves in trouble for articulating the same views in their workplace on Monday.</p><p
    pid="b.799.2/12">Marriage charities that were set up to promote traditional marriage
    at a time when nobody dreamed that there was an alternative could find themselves
    shut down. Only this week, the last Catholic adoption agency, St Margaret&#8217;s
    in Glasgow, was ordered by the Scottish charity regulator to drop its policy of
    requiring prospective adopters to have been married for two years.</p><p pid="b.799.2/13">According
    to a leak from the Department for Education, officials are worried that teachers
    will be in the firing line if marriage is redefined. Indeed, my right hon. Friend
    the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sports was pressed on that point
    by John Humphrys on the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme last week. She admitted
    that even in RE lessons in religious state schools, teachers would have to teach
    the subject in &#8220;a balanced way.&#8221; Many people in this country believe
    profoundly that traditional marriage is between a man and a woman, and they want
    the right to teach that in school.</p><p pid="b.799.2/14">The Education Act 1996
    requires schools to teach about the nature of marriage, so if marriage is redefined
    they will be required to teach about the nature of same-sex marriage. Teachers
    who decline will find themselves in the firing line in the same way as Lillian
    Ladele. Why should we put thousands of teachers at risk of dismissal for believing
    that marriage is between a man and a woman? Labour and the teaching unions will
    find themselves in a firestorm if they do not protect their members. Indeed, extant
    counsel&#8217;s opinion tells us that the courts are unlikely to rule in favour
    of parents who want their children excused from classes teaching same-sex marriage.</p><p
    pid="b.799.2/15">This ten-minute rule Bill is not a blocking measure to stop same-sex
    marriage; it would simply insert in the Equality Act 2010 protection for a person&#8217;s
    conscientious views on the definition of marriage. It would protect those who
    hold the traditional view that marriage is between a man and a woman, just as
    it would protect those who hold a contrary view. People&#8217;s right to belief
    and conscientious right to freedom of expression must be protected. That does
    not mean that those conscientious views override all other considerations, but
    simply that conscientious beliefs about the definition of marriage are a protected
    characteristic that must be taken account of.</p><p pid="b.799.2/16">I believe
    we must protect the right of conscience. For over a century, atheist teachers
    have been allowed to express their opinions and no one can force them to teach
    religion. Pro-life doctors cannot be forced to participate in abortions. During
    the second world war when we were in a life and death situation, we allowed the
    existence of conscientious objections. In 21st century Britain, however, woe betide
    anyone who refuses to declare full support for same-sex marriage in the workplace
    or the classroom.</p><p pid="b.799.2/17">In my time in Parliament I have battled
    for freedom of speech&#8212;we had a great victory on section 5 of the Public
    Order Act 1986&#8212;and this is not a fringe concern.</p><p pid="b.799.2/18">We
    go around the world&#8212;we have just heard a statement on Mali&#8212;investing
    blood and treasure to extend freedom, but let us not forget the freedom on our
    own doorstep. Some Members who support redefining marriage might be utterly convinced
    about the rightness of their cause. I respect their views, but surely they must
    be generous towards those who disagree. They should ensure that the law respects
    and does not trample over people&#8217;s deeply held beliefs.</p><p pid="b.799.2/19">Millions
    of our fellow citizens believe passionately in marriage, and they believe their
    own marriage defines who they are. They do not want their marriages redefined
    over their heads by politicians. They believe that history, biology, ethics and
    religion all tell us that marriage is, uniquely, the coming together of one man
    and one woman for life to the exclusion of all others. I believe that these people
    are entitled to protection not just in their churches but in their workplace,
    at home, on Facebook and when they teach in the classroom. They are entitled to
    talk about their beliefs on marriage&#8212;such beliefs are mainstream and sensible&#8212;and
    should do so without fear. If we do not believe in freedom of speech for those
    with whom we disagree passionately, I believe we have no passion for freedom of
    speech.</p>

    Speaker, you and I know that every marriage is different&#8212;indeed, any husband

    a loving stable relationship to strengthen us and mutual support throughout our
    lives. I believe that that should be embraced by more couples. The depth of feeling,
    love and commitment between same-sex couples is no different from that depth of
    feeling between opposite-sex couples. The Bill enables society to recognise that
    commitment in the same way, too, through marriage. Parliament should value people
    equally in the law, and enabling same-sex couples to marry removes the current
    differentiation and distinction.</p><p pid="b.125.3/3">There is no single view

    to the consequences of its introduction for low-income households affected by
    disability; further believes that it will adversely affect, amongst others, families
    of service personnel, foster families and those struggling with the effects of
    family breakdown; notes that some parts of the UK will be disproportionately hit
    because of the mismatch between the available social housing stock and the needs
    of tenants; further notes that according to the Department for Work and Pensions&#8217;
    Equality Impact Assessment, 63 per cent of the 660,000 claimants affected by the
    under-occupancy penalty or their partners are disabled; believes that the measure

    a few weeks&#8217; time the Government&#8217;s notorious under-occupancy penalty,
    or bedroom tax, is set to come into effect. Across the UK, it is going to cut
    for tenants by an average of &#163;14 a week, or over &#163;700 a year, the housing
    benefit of an estimated 660,000 low-income households who are deemed to be living
    in a home bigger than their needs require. The measure is causing anxiety and
    anger in equal measure. It follows hard on the heels of punitive cuts to tax credits
    that have already slashed the budgets of low-income families, and it compounds
    the real-terms cut to the safety net of social protection for people who are unable
    to work because of sickness or disability, and for those rendered unemployed or
    under-employed by economic circumstances well beyond their control. This bedroom
    tax is a further assault on the precarious finances of the people who are already
    bearing the brunt of the Government&#8217;s austerity measures, which, as we have
    seen this week, simply are not working. The under-occupancy penalty is inherently

  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="b.1210.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="b.1210.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    commend the Bill in its present form to the House.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/3">The
    first point to reflect on, in considering the Bill in its entirety, is the debt
    we owe to our security and intelligence services. Unfortunately, we face unprecedented
    threats at different times from various enemies, both at home and abroad. It is
    extremely important that we have highly efficient intelligence and security services
    to protect the lives of our citizens and the normal civilised business of the
    country. We have to support the intelligence services on which we rely so heavily.</p><p
    pid="b.1210.2/4">Secondly, this country upholds the highest standards of human
    rights in this area of its activities, as in other areas. We all expect those
    who work in our intelligence and security services to have the same regard to
    the values that we are defending as everyone else does&#8212;that we do have regard
    to the rule of law. The British Government are, and, as far I am aware, always
    have been, firmly against the use of torture, firmly against unlawful and extraordinary
    rendition, and firmly against practices on which some of our allies take a more
    relaxed</p><p pid="b.1210.2/5">view. I would like to think that the British intelligence
    and security services are not only among the best in the world, but uphold much
    higher standards in the way they conduct themselves than is true of the vast majority
    of the nation states of the world.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/6">The vast majority of
    Members agree that we are grateful to the security services, and that it is important
    that they are held as accountable as everyone else. We follow another principle
    that the Government, as far as possible, hold dear, which is that of transparency:
    avoiding unnecessary secrecy wherever possible, and being as open in our dealings
    with the public in every aspect of our public life. Plainly, that has to be modified
    to a certain extent to protect the absolutely essential secrecy that our security
    services need, and which the people who co-operate with them, the agents who help
    us and the various people we have to rely on throughout the world, need.</p><p
    pid="b.1210.2/7">I believe that the part of the Bill that we will look back on
    with greatest pleasure is the considerable steps we are taking to give extra powers
    to the Intelligence and Security Committee. In ensuring that the security services
    are held accountable, accountability to Parliament is extremely important. I will
    not rehearse all the arguments, which have taken most of today, but the Committee
    is now to be truly a Committee of Parliament. The House of Commons will be able
    to elect the membership&#8212;on the nomination of the Prime Minister, but members
    will be appointed by parliamentary vote. The Prime Minister&#8217;s nomination
    is a necessary precaution in case some unknown feature of a Member of Parliament&#8217;s
    background might make him or her a less suitable member of the Committee than
    would otherwise be the case.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/8">As we have seen over the years,
    the Intelligence and Security Committee is one of the most important Committees
    of the House. Its membership, not surprisingly, tends to comprise heavyweight
    individuals from all parts of the House of Commons, with a membership that is
    highly respected in all parts of the House for the work it tries to do. However,
    I will not repeat what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home
    Department set out in the debate. We have examined in detail the various processes
    that we now have in hand to enable the Committee to require evidence to be given
    to it and to hold the security services thoroughly to account, in all the sensible
    circumstances that can be managed, while at the same time ensuring that no risk
    is posed to national safety and national security.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/9">The
    most controversial part of the Bill is the one we debated on Monday, in which
    we seek to make the security and intelligence services more accountable to the
    judiciary and courts of this country, particularly as in the last few years a
    growing number of people have alleged before our courts malpractice against the
    security services and sought substantial damages for events in which they say
    our security services were complicit. Things are plainly unsatisfactory as they
    stand, and we have all quoted many distinguished members of the judiciary to illustrate
    that. Opponents persuade themselves that they are so against the principle of
    closed proceedings of any kind that they wish to keep the present law, which they
    regard as satisfactory.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/10">I am afraid I am still at the
    stage where I do not see how on earth we can say that the present law is satisfactory.
    People bring claims and are prepared to give evidence, as they are perfectly entitled
    to, in support of them.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/11">The nature of the evidence that
    the security and intelligence services and the Government would wish to produce
    to defend some of those claims is of the kind that cannot possibly be given in
    open court. The courts have made it clear that sometimes there is indeed scope
    for closed proceedings, but that they cannot be held through an ordinary civil
    action unless Parliament has decided the circumstances in which these should be
    allowed.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/12">We already have closed proceedings in this country
    in several areas&#8212;there are about 14 instances of different jurisdictions
    where we have closed proceedings, largely in the immigration field. It is of course
    less than perfect justice, because the only possible challenge to the evidence
    is from special advocates who have been security cleared, and they are not as
    free as they would be in an open court case to take full instructions from their
    clients. Everybody knows that, but in fact they have more weight as advocates
    than most people appreciate. Given the circumstances, most judges are prepared
    to listen to challenges, realising that they have to bear in mind that they need
    to be particularly scrupulous, because there are limitations in how far the evidence
    is being tested before them.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/13">The best test is that special
    advocates win in closed sessions&#8212;I have been fond of citing one or two instances
    as these proceedings have gone along. The last case that the Government lost&#8212;that
    of Abu Qatada, which caused a tremendous public controversy and still is&#8212;was
    lost before a judge, Mr Justice Mitting, who does not have the reputation of being
    a melting-heart liberal. Abu Qatada won in closed proceedings in a British court,
    defeating my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and the Government in our attempts
    to remove him for a trial in Jordan. Obviously the judge was not satisfied that
    torture would not play a part in the proceedings if Abu Qatada was sent there.
    The idea that Ministers have the ability to present things to a judge in circumstances
    where the closed advocates have no hope is mistaken. What we will get is a judgment,
    whereas what we get at the moment is silence.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/14">In the main,
    we have been attacked by people who say how much they deplore secrecy and silence,
    yet the effect of being granted a public interest immunity certificate, which
    is the only course open to Ministers wishing to withhold evidence that could damage
    national security, is total silence. The evidence cannot be used by the claimants,
    cannot be taken into account by the judge and is not available to the defence.
    As we all know, cases are being brought with increasing regularity in which the
    Government have no alternative but to offer no defence, because no evidence can
    be called, and then to start negotiating the amount money to be paid in compensation.</p><p
    pid="b.1210.2/15">I have never given exact figures for the compensation involved&#8212;although
    some have appeared following interviews with me&#8212;because the claimants usually
    want to enter into confidentiality agreements on the settlement. However, there
    is no harm in telling the House that millions of pounds are being paid out to
    claimants whose cases have never been tested or challenged. I make no apology
    for repeating my suspicion&#8212;one that is held by most objective people&#8212;that
    there is a serious risk that some of the money is finding its way to very undesirable
    quarters, and probably to terrorist groups in the case of certain plaintiffs.
    I am not talking about all of them, and I will not say which of them this applies</p><p
    pid="b.1210.2/16">to&#8212;that was never decided by the courts&#8212;but some
    of those people will have links to organisations that will have some of that money
    on them. I do not think that the public understand why the Government cannot defend
    themselves. That gives rise to genuine disquiet among perfectly intelligent liberal
    members of the general public.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/17">We have had a long, satisfactory
    debate, during which the Bill has been transformed in both Houses. We are still
    not in total agreement on the wording, but we agree on the principles. The judge
    will have the widest possible discretion to decide that he is going to hear evidence
    in closed proceedings only when it is relevant and has to be heard to decide the
    case, and when it would damage national security if it were given to the wider
    world. Furthermore, the just and effective administration of justice will have
    to be served by hearing it in private. I will not repeat all the arguments that
    were put on Monday.</p><p pid="b.1210.2/18">The overall effect of the Bill will
    be to improve the reassurance that we can give to the public and to the world
    that we uphold the highest standards in this country, and that we seek to maintain
    them by holding accountable those who work on our behalf. I believe that the outcome
    is not only legally sound but an eminently sensible common-sense solution to the
    obvious practical problems that arise when we wish to combine the rule of law
    with the protection of national safety and security. I commend the Bill to the
    House.</p>'

    squeezed, their cost of living rise as a result of higher VAT and their wages

  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time. It is a great
    pleasure to present this year’s Finance Bill—a Bill that further demonstrates
    the Government’s commitment to creating a tax system that is fairer, simpler and
    more transparent, and one that will promote growth and reward work. Unlike the
    Opposition, those of us on the Government Benches recognise that we have to address
    the fiscal mess left us. That means that we have to resist the voices of those
    wanting to engage in a further splurge in borrowing. But we can take steps to
    make ourselves more competitive and help people with the cost of living, and that
    is what we will do in the Bill. I will happily take interventions this afternoon,
    but to give some structure to my speech it is perhaps worth while my laying out
    to the Chamber the order in which I intend to discuss the Bill. First, I will
    talk about the measures that will support growth and enterprise, then the measures
    that will tackle avoidance and evasion, and then the measures that will increase
    fairness. Finally, I will talk about the way in which the Bill will help to deliver
    a simpler tax system.

  question: The Speaker put forthwith the Question already proposed from the Chair
    (Standing Order No. 83F), That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 25.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 25.
  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="b.174.3/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 25.</p><p class="" pid="b.174.3/2"
    pwmotiontext="yes">Back in October, the Government introduced a Bill to this House
    that contained a number of important growth measures designed to help stimulate
    the economy. I am very pleased to report that both Houses of Parliament have given
    the Bill the priority it deserves, and that six months after its introduction
    both Houses have completed their consideration. We must now reach agreement with
    the other place on the final version of the Bill.</p><p pid="b.174.3/3">Let me
    explain that the Government agree with 38 of the 40 amendments that have been
    made. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
    will address those in the second group of amendments for debate. It is right that
    we set out our reasons for our disagreement with the other place in two important
    respects.</p><p pid="b.174.3/4">The Government do not support amendment 25, which
    seeks to remove clause 27&#8212;a clause that this House supported and that would
    establish the new employment status of employee shareholder. I urge the House
    to confirm its view that this imaginative proposal should continue to be made
    available and clause 27 should be retained.</p><p pid="b.174.3/5">Clause 27 establishes
    a new employment status in our labour market&#8212;the employee shareholder&#8212;in
    addition to the existing categories of worker and employee. Employee shareholders
    will have more employment rights than workers but fewer rights than employees.
    Importantly, employee shareholders will be given at least &#163;2,000 of shares
    in the company they work for, or in its parent company. The first &#163;2,000
    of value will not attract income tax or national insurance contributions, and
    the first &#163;50,000 of shares will not be subject to capital gains tax.</p><p
    pid="b.174.3/6">British companies are competing in a global race to increase their
    competitiveness and create wealth. What is at stake here is choice and a new status
    that companies can use to give themselves a competitive edge and more flexibility
    in deciding how to structure their work force. By combining share ownership and
    favourable tax treatment&#8212;with appropriate steps to prevent any tax avoidance&#8212;we
    are giving companies, especially young companies, a tool that may tip the balance
    in their favour as they seek to attract high-calibre individuals who can have
    a disproportionately positive impact on how the company performs. That is why
    the Government want to create the new employment status&#8212;to promote enterprise
    and aspiration.</p><p pid="b.174.3/7">Much has been said about the new employee
    shareholder status. Throughout the scrutiny in this House, I stressed from the
    beginning that we do not want people coerced into this new type of status. That
    is why the Government chose to add protections to the status on Report. We added
    protections for existing employees by creating a new unfair dismissal right and
    by inserting the right not to be subjected to any detriment if they turn down
    an employee shareholder contract. Those protections are important. They allow
    existing employees, if offered an employee shareholder contract, to say no, in
    the knowledge that the law will protect their decision.</p><p pid="b.174.3/8">The
    Government have always been clear that this measure is voluntary for both individuals
    and companies to use if it suits their circumstances or business needs. For people
    on job seeker&#8217;s allowance, our priority is to minimise periods of unemployment
    by helping them to move into work as soon as possible. During proceedings in this
    House, I listened carefully to concerns raised by, among others, my right hon.
    Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" name="Andrew
    Stunell">the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase>, who is in his place
    today. In response to the concerns he expressed in Committee, I agreed that guidance
    to decision makers in job centres would make it clear that an individual should
    not be mandated if there were good reasons for refusing an employee shareholder
    offer. However, the other place was unconvinced that this employment status would
    be truly voluntary for jobseeker&#8217;s allowance claimants if there was the
    possibility&#8212;however remote&#8212;that a claimant could lose their JSA if
    they turned down an employee shareholder job.</p><p pid="b.174.3/9">I want to
    make it absolutely clear that this new employment status is voluntary. That is
    why the Government have looked at all this again in the light of comments and
    speeches by the noble Lords in that debate. We have decided now to remove any
    remaining ambiguity, which I hope will reassure both this House and the other
    place. I can tell the House that as a result of considering the policy further
    we have decided that job centre advisers will not be able to mandate job seekers
    to apply for employee shareholder positions. The Government will amend the guidance
    for DWP jobcentre advisers to state explicitly that a jobseeker cannot be mandated
    to apply for an employee shareholder job. Draft guidance will shortly be placed
    in the Library.</p>

    and more on food banks. Having moved on from the debate on hot food, it is sad
    that we are now talking about more people having to rely on food handouts. Those
    handouts, of course, show the generosity of many people in our local communities,
    and I applaud them for the work they are doing, but surely in this day and age

    the co-ordination of national economic policies across the EU; and thirdly to
    reflect on our great good fortune in not having joined the single currency, despite
    the siren voices heard in this place and elsewhere&#8212;thanks, in no small measure,
    to those who had the courage and foresight to speak against British involvement
    at a time when their warnings were subject to such derision.</p>

    believe that the Gracious Speech offers no answers for squeezed households facing
    a cost of living crisis; regret that the economy is flatlining, unemployment is
    rising, borrowing is set to be &#163;245 billion more than planned and the Office
    of Budget Responsibility has confirmed that by 2015 people will be worse off than
    they were in 2010; and call on your Government to take real action to get people
    back into employment, build more affordable homes, tackle rising energy and water
    bills, tackle the growing cost of getting to work and instability in private sector
    housing rents and tenancies and end extortionate letting agents&#8217; fees and
    charges.&#8217;.</p><p pid="a.517.1/3">We debate the Queen&#8217;s Speech at a
    time of crisis for millions of people in our country. This was a golden opportunity
    for the Government to show that they were in touch with the nation&#8217;s concerns
    and that they would help with the rising cost of living and offer hope to families
    who are seeing their dreams evaporating with every year that passes. But this
    Queen&#8217;s Speech will not take the pressure off the squeezed middle, lessen
    the anger of commuters powerless to halt the relentless rise of rail fares or
    address the choice between heating and eating for our most vulnerable senior citizens.
    For the shop worker whose hours have been cut, putting them with the 1.5 million
    people who are part-time through no choice of their own, for the middle manager
    workless for the first time at 50, for the design graduate offered only unpaid
    internships and for the parents whose child is still living with them at an age
    when they should have a home of their own, this Queen&#8217;s Speech has only
    confirmed what they dreaded: jobs and growth will have to wait and living standards
    will continue to fall.</p><p pid="a.517.1/4">While the wealthiest 1% will see
    their earnings rise with the Chancellor&#8217;s spring bonus, everyone else will
    have to settle for less. They will be expected to make ends meet, cut corners,
    postpone the holiday and perhaps join the 5 million families who, according to
    Which?, use credit or savings to pay for food. The Queen&#8217;s Speech is not
    just a missed opportunity, but a denial of the power of Government to change lives
    for the better. I believe that Government can stimulate jobs, foster growth, encourage
    investment and skill a work force for today&#8217;s jobs and those of tomorrow,
    but not if the golden rule, at every turn, is to cut the deficit first, whatever
    the impact, cost and evidence.</p>'

    regret that the Gracious Speech has no answer to a flatlining economy, the rising
    cost of living and a deficit reduction plan that has stalled, nor does it address
    the long-term economic challenges Britain faces; believe that the priority for
    the Government now should be growth and jobs and that we need reform of the European
    Union, not four years of economic uncertainty which legislating now for an in/out
    referendum in 2017 would create; call on your Government to take action now to
    kickstart the economy, help families with the rising cost of living, and make
    long-term economic reforms for the future; and call on your Government to implement
    the five point plan for jobs and growth, including bringing forward long-term
    infrastructure investment, building 100,000 affordable homes and introducing a
    compulsory jobs guarantee for the long-term unemployed in order to create</p><p

    pid="b.655.6/4">Thank you for your ruling, Mr Speaker. It is certainly in line
    with my understanding of the particular interpretation of that Standing Order,
    and I hope that it satisfies the Leader of the House as well.</p><p pid="b.655.6/5">It
    is an honour to open the final debate on the Queen&#8217;s Speech today, and to
    move the amendment, which you have selected on behalf of Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition.
    It is a Labour amendment that calls for decisive action and a stimulus now to
    kick-start the recovery, boost living standards and get the deficit down, including
    100,000 affordable homes, urgent action to accelerate infrastructure investment
    and reforms to get young people and the long-term unemployed back to work, with
    a compulsory jobs guarantee.</p><p pid="b.655.6/6">The amendment also proposes
    radical long-term reforms to promote economic growth and investment in manufacturing,
    services and our creative industries by implementing the recommendations of the
    Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, legislating now for a 2030 decarbonisation
    target to give businesses the certainty they need to invest here in Britain and
    setting up a proper British investment bank. It is a one nation Labour amendment,
    which stands in marked contrast to the complete and utter shambles we have seen
    from the Government over the past seven days since the Gracious Address&#8212;a
    divided coalition, out of ideas and running out of road, and a weak Prime Minister,
    out of touch and fast losing control of his party and his own Cabinet.</p>

    the officials who have worked very long hours to ensure that the proceedings of

    work they have put into the Bill.</p><p pid="a.1152.2/4">I have spent some time
    thinking about how I would address the House on Third Reading. As I have said,
    for many reasons, the subject draws strong opinion from Members on both sides
    of the House. Just as the Civil Partnership 2004 Act was discussed in pubs, homes,
    church halls and communities throughout the country, so has the Bill. Over the
    past few months, I have listened carefully to many different voices within and
    outside Parliament. Throughout the passage of the Bill, we have had passionate
    but fair debates. In the best traditions of the House, we have maintained respect
    for one another&#8217;s views, and had open and constructive discussions with
    all involved.</p>

    clause 9 calls for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, within six months of Royal

    to be covered by that 10% rate should be determined by the Exchequer yield from

    an ever-closer Europe. As a party we should see this as a marker of the renegotiation
    that will come after we have won a majority in the next general election; it will
    be part of a process of bringing powers back to this country, which we desperately
    need to do, and of restoring a position that is right for the United Kingdom.

    of this country. It is so essential that we act in the interests of this country

    concerned at recent reports that plans are not in place to avert an Accident and

    Bruce Keogh have seen increasing problems since May 2010; further believes that
    the Government&#8217;s failure to implement the key recommendations of the Francis
    Report, combined with the disruption of the recent NHS reorganisation, risks making
    it more likely that failures of care will happen in future; further notes the
    Government&#8217;s recent commitment to openness and transparency in the NHS;
    therefore calls on the Government to publish the NHS transition risk register
    as ordered by the Information Commissioner and Information Rights Tribunal; and

    an NHS which, right now, is feeling battered, bruised and under attack. It has
    just come through the worst crisis in accident and emergency for more than a decade
    and it is only months away from another winter which, if nothing changes, will
    most likely be just as bad or possibly worse for patients. I spend considerable
    time on the NHS front line shadowing staff, so I pick up what they say. They feel
    exhausted, unsupported and have a profound sense of uncertainty about where the
    NHS is heading. Today it is in a fragile condition. The way the Government conduct
    themselves in the coming months and the decisions they make will have a major
    bearing on their ability to manage the risks that the NHS is facing. For the sake
    of patients everywhere, they must urgently raise the morale of NHS staff and restore
    some trust. Later I will make some suggestions on how that can be done.</p><p

    happening now. Standards have fallen, not only in the 14 trusts considered in
    the Keogh review, but across the NHS. Throughout the first six months of this
    year, hospitals were sailing dangerously close to the wind, operating way beyond
    safe bed occupancy levels, with general chaos in accident and emergency. How did
    we get here? To hear Ministers now, it is as though the last three years have
    not happened&#8212;it is all about the last Government. However, one of the main
    reasons why the NHS is struggling is the destabilising effect of a reorganisation
    that nobody wanted and nobody voted for. It is exactly three years since the bombshell
    of the &#8220;Liberating the NHS&#8221; White Paper landed on an unsuspecting
    NHS.</p><p pid="b.1171.2/5">This Government falsely accuse the last Government

    confirmation by them that chemical weapons have been used in Syria;</p><p pid="c.1440.0/4">(b)

    and the evidence submitted;</p><p pid="c.1440.0/6">(d) there is a clear legal
    basis in international law for taking collective military action to protect the
    Syrian people on humanitarian grounds;</p><p pid="c.1440.0/7">(e) such action
    must have regard to the potential consequences in the region, and must therefore
    be legal, proportionate, time-limited and have precise and achievable objectives
    designed to deter the future use of prohibited chemical weapons in Syria; and</p><p
    pid="c.1440.0/8">(f) the Prime Minister reports further to the House on the achievement
    of these conditions so that the House can vote on UK participation in such action,
    and that any such vote should relate solely to efforts to deter the use of chemical
    weapons and does not sanction any wider action in Syria.&#8217;.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/9">I
    start by joining the Prime Minister in expressing revulsion at the killing of
    hundreds of innocent civilians in Ghutah on <phrase class="date" code="2013-08-21">21
    August</phrase>. This was a moral outrage, and the international community is
    right to condemn it. As the Prime Minister said, everyone in the House and</p><p
    pid="c.1440.0/10">most people in the country will have seen the pictures of men,
    women and children gasping for breath and dying as a result of this heinous attack.
    I can assure hon. Members that the divide that exists does not exist over the
    condemnation of the use of chemical weapons and the fact that it breaches international
    law; nor does it lie in the willingness to condemn the regime of President Assad.
    The question facing this is House is what, if any, military action we should take
    and what criteria should determine that decision. That is what I want to focus
    on in my speech today.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/11">It is right to say at the beginning
    of my remarks that the Prime Minister said a couple of times in his speech words
    to the effect that, &#8220;We are not going to get further involved in that conflict.
    This does not change our stance our Syria.&#8221; I have got to say to the Prime
    Minister, with the greatest respect, that that is simply not the case. For me
    that does not rule out military intervention&#8212;I want to be clear about this&#8212;but
    I do not think anybody in this House or in the country should be under any illusions
    about the effect on our relationship to the conflict in Syria if we were to intervene
    militarily. As I say, and as I shall develop in my remarks, that does not, for
    me, rule out intervention, but we need to be clear-eyed about the impact that
    this would have.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/12">Let me also say that this is one of the
    most solemn duties that this House possesses, and in our minds should be this
    simple question: in upholding international law and legitimacy, how can me make
    the lives of the Syrian people better? We should also have in our minds&#8212;it
    is right to remember it on this occasion&#8212;the duty we owe to the exceptional
    men and women of our armed forces and their families, who will face the direct
    consequences of any decision we make.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/13">The basis on which
    we make this decision is of fundamental importance, because the basis of making
    the decision determines the legitimacy and moral authority of any action that
    we undertake. That is why our amendment asks the House to support a clear and
    legitimate road map to decision on this issue&#8212;a set of steps that will enable
    us to judge any recommended international action. I want to develop the argument
    about why I believe this sequential road map is the right thing for the House
    to support today.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/14">Most of all, if we follow this road
    map, it can assure the country and the international community that if we take
    action, we will follow the right, legitimate and legal course, not an artificial
    timetable or a political timetable set elsewhere. I think that is very important
    for any decision we make. This is fundamental to the principles of Britain: a
    belief in the rule of law and a belief that any military action we take must be
    justified in terms of the cause and also the potential consequences. We should
    strain every sinew to make the international institutions that we have in our
    world work to deal with the outrages in Syria.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/15">Let me
    turn to the conditions in our amendment. First&#8212;this is where the Prime Minister
    and I now agree&#8212;we must let the UN weapons inspectors do their work and
    let them report to the Security Council. Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary-General,
    yesterday said about the weapons inspectors:</p><p pid="c.1440.0/16">&#8220;Let
    them conclude their work for four days and then we will have to analyse scientifically
    with experts and then&#8230;we will have to report to the Security Council for
    any actions.&#8221;</p><p pid="c.1440.0/17">The weapons inspectors are in the
    midst of their work and will be reporting in the coming days. That is why today
    could not have been the day on which the House was asked to decide on military
    action. It is surely a basic point for this House that evidence should precede
    decision, not decision precede evidence. I am glad that, on reflection, the Prime
    Minister accepted this yesterday.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/18">Now it is true&#8212;some
    have already raised this issue&#8212;that the weapons inspectors cannot reach
    a judgment on the attribution of blame. That is beyond their mandate. Some might
    think that that makes their work essentially irrelevant. I disagree. If the UN
    weapons inspectors conclude that chemical weapons have been used, in the eyes
    of this country and of the world that will confer legitimacy on the finding beyond
    the view of any individual country or any intelligence agency. What is more, it
    is possible that what the weapons inspectors discover could give the world greater
    confidence in identifying the perpetrators of this horrific attack.</p><p pid="c.1440.0/19">The
    second step in our road map makes it clear that there must be compelling evidence
    that the Syrian regime was responsible for the attack. I welcome the letter from
    the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee today, and I note the Arab League&#8217;s
    view of President Assad&#8217;s culpability. Of course, as the Prime Minister
    said, in conflict there is always reason for doubt, but the greater the weight
    of evidence the better. On Tuesday we were promised the release of American intelligence
    to prove the regime&#8217;s culpability. We await publication of that evidence,
    which I gather will be later today. That evidence, too, will be important in building
    up the body of evidence to show that President Assad was responsible.</p>'

    its belief in the need for greater transparency in the lobbying industry and in
    British politics, and considers that there should be a universal register of all
    professional lobbyists backed by a code of conduct and sanctions, clear rules
    on third party campaigning, and real reform to get the big money out of politics;
    but declines to give a Second Reading to the Transparency of Lobbying, Third Party
    Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill because the proposals on lobbying
    cover only a tiny minority of the industry and will make lobbying less transparent,
    and the proposals on third party campaigning amount to a gag on charities and
    campaigners who have a democratic right to participate in important debates in
    the run up to elections; and strongly believes that the publication of such a

    consultation with affected parties.</p><p pid="b.186.0/3">This is one of the worst
    Bills that I have seen any Government produce in a very long time. The last Bill
    this bad might even have been the Health and Social Care Act 2012, and the Leader
    of the House of Commons had his fingerprints all over that one, too. To be fair
    to him, he has found himself in a very difficult place. He has been landed with
    this risible and misconceived Bill and told to ram it through the Commons with
    unseemly haste in time for the next election.</p><p pid="b.186.0/4">I am told
    that it is not a Bill with many champions in government, where a history of previous
    employment in the lobbying industry is common. Nothing wrong with that, we might
    say, but it has created a notable reluctance on the part of all sorts of Ministers
    to touch the Bill with a bargepole, and this afternoon we all understand why.
    They have looked at the ceiling; they have looked at the floor; they have muttered
    among themselves in the hope that they would not be chosen to pilot the Bill through
    the House. The Leader of the House has drawn the short straw, along with the ever-willing

    notes that this has been the slowest economic recovery on record, and that the

    that average earnings are almost &#163;1,500 a year lower in real terms than they

    families an average of &#163;891 in 2013-14 according to the Institute for Fiscal

    average of &#163;100,000 for the 13,000 people with incomes over &#163;1 million;
    and calls on the Government to ensure that the recovery is strengthened, sustainable
    and its benefits fairly shared by getting more people into work, bringing forward
    capital investment, as recommended by the IMF, introducing a compulsory jobs guarantee,
    backing fair taxes by reintroducing a 10p rate of income tax, paid for by a mansion
    tax on houses worth over &#163;2 million, taking action on rip-off rail fares

    thank Members from both sides of the House for their contribution to the debate.
    We have been busily engaged in considering the Bill on Second Reading, in Committee
    and on Report on either side of the summer and conference recesses and during
    the September sitting. The contributions of Members have exposed the issues and
    enabled the debate to take place.</p><p pid="a.253.0/3">As on Second Reading,
    I thank the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee for its scrutiny. I
    met the Committee on the morning of the Second Reading debate and my colleagues
    met it before that. The Chair of the Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40461"
    name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen)</phrase>,
    made manifest his irritation with the amount of time that was available for that
    scrutiny on several occasions. However, I thank him and his colleagues for their
    participation.</p><p pid="a.253.0/4">With regard to our debates yesterday and
    today, I wrote to the Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights on Monday to
    explain in detail why I believe the Bill to be compatible with the European convention
    on human rights. I look forward to the Committee&#8217;s report. My colleagues
    and I will take full account of its conclusions, which I hope it will reach soon.</p><p
    pid="a.253.0/5">I thank my good friend and colleague, the Deputy Leader of the
    House. I also thank the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
    Skills, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" name="Jo
    Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>, who has
    responsibility for employee relations. Owing to the length of today&#8217;s debates,
    she has not been able to explain part 3 as fully as she would have wished. I am
    extremely grateful to the former Minister with responsibility for political and
    constitutional reform, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40458"
    name="Chloe Smith">the Member for Norwich North (Miss Smith)</phrase>. I am also
    grateful to the officials who have supported the ministerial team and to parliamentary
    counsel for all their work on the Bill.</p><p pid="a.253.0/6">I do not want this
    moment to pass without expressing my thanks to the kaleidoscope of talent&#8212;I
    use those words advisedly&#8212;that has participated in the debate from the Opposition
    Front Bench. I know that in order to try to construct an Opposition they found
    it interesting to see how our team was constructed. The shadow Leader of the House
    and the hon. Members for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith), for Liverpool,
    West Derby (Stephen Twigg), for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett), for Harrow West (Mr
    Thomas), for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) and for Caerphilly (Wayne
    David) all contributed to our consideration of the Bill. They were an Opposition
    in search of an argument and they did their best.</p><p pid="a.253.0/7">The Government
    made a commitment that we would be the most open Government ever and that we would
    promote transparency in public life. We have sought to improve public confidence
    in our political system. We have been the first Government to publish details
    of the</p><p pid="a.253.0/8">meetings that Ministers and permanent secretaries
    have had with external organisations. We have published details of our relationships
    with media editors and the like. We have published details of hospitality, departmental
    business plans and procurement processes. There is a wide range of raw data that
    people can assess for themselves. We have always sought to take transparency further.</p><p
    pid="a.253.0/9">The purpose of the Bill is to achieve transparency by fulfilling
    our coalition commitment to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists so that
    the public know who lobbyists represent when they meet decision makers, and by
    making it clearer where and how money is being spent by third parties at elections
    to influence the outcomes of those elections. We are also seeking transparency
    by giving the public, and members of trade unions, the confidence that they know
    who their members are. Together, those measures will increase transparency in
    the political system.</p>

    streets and town and city centres are vital to local economies; acknowledges that
    many small businesses and retailers are struggling under the pressure of business
    rates rises; notes that since 2010 shop vacancy rates have remained at over 14
    per cent but that there has been a 20 per cent increase in numbers of payday loan
    shops and a three per cent increase in numbers of betting shops in the last year;
    is concerned that recent changes to permitted development rights and use classes
    are likely to lead to an over-concentration of betting shops and payday loan companies
    in many areas, against the wishes of local people and businesses; and calls on
    the Government to give local communities a greater say over the shape of their
    own high streets and town and city centres, including control over use classes,
    to help encourage the more widespread use of neighbourhood planning and greater
    cooperation between local communities and businesses and to cut and then freeze
    business rates from 2015 to help small businesses on UK high streets and town
    and city centres.</p><p pid="b.802.2/3">When introducing the Portas pilots a few
    years ago, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40643" name="Grant

    his customary understatement and modesty, said that</p><p pid="b.802.2/4">&#8220;these
    pilots can be the vanguard of a high street revolution, and others can look to
    their example to kick start a renaissance of our town centres.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.802.2/5">However,
    recent data show us that this high street revolution has yet to materialise. I
    think it is wrong to place the blame at the door of Mary Portas, because there
    was much in her original report that was helpful. I want to place the blame for
    such poor progress in reviving our high streets firmly where it belongs: with
    the Government.</p><p pid="b.802.2/6">The Government&#8217;s failed policies for
    the high street undoubtedly start with the sluggishness of our economic recovery,
    but I want to focus specifically on what is wrong with their approach to regenerating
    our high streets and town centres. The past five years have seen a significant
    squeeze on household and personal incomes, resulting in muted spending and an
    increase in retail failures. The high street has not only been hit by falling
    living standards but has had to contend with the rise in internet shopping. Yes,
    shopping habits are changing, but the high streets and town centres are still
    very important to the well-being of our communities, yet the Government&#8217;s
    policies are not rising to the challenge of revitalising and regenerating them.</p>'

    class="" pid="b.937.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to permit voters to recall their elected representatives in specified circumstances;
    and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="b.937.2/3">All MPs are aware of just how
    strained the relationship between people and power has become. We have reached
    a depressing point in our history when even thoughtful commentators find it easier
    just to agree limply when they hear someone shrieking that all politicians are
    liars and thieves. To mount a defence goes against the collective popular gut
    feeling and requires more energy than most people have.</p><p pid="b.937.2/4">What
    worries me is how low that issue is on the Westminster political agenda. There
    is a sense that it is just a passing problem and that, in time, people will come
    back to the fold because there is no real alternative. Some even blame the expenses
    scandal, as if everything was okay before 2009. We know that it was not. Voter
    turnout has been decreasing for years. The memberships of political parties have
    plummeted to miserable levels. Among voters, there is an overwhelming sense that
    politics has become so detached and remote that, no matter how they vote or even
    whether they vote, nothing can change. I think that we are at an important turning
    point.</p><p pid="b.937.2/5">Democracy has evolved in this country, on the whole
    without too much violence. We should consider the first Reform Act of 1832, when
    the vast social transformation that had been brought about by industrialisation
    meant that politicians had no alternative but to yield to society&#8217;s demand
    that they broaden the franchise and give more people more ownership of their democracy.
    That happened again in 1867, when reforms were brought in that effectively doubled
    the number of men who were able to vote. More reforms followed in 1884. In 1918,
    the first women were allowed to vote, albeit only those over the age of 30 and
    with property to their name. That changed in 1928, when everyone over the age
    of 21 could vote, whether they were a man or a woman. In 1969, the voting age
    was lowered to 18. In one way or another, each of those steps has involved Parliament,
    sometimes reluctantly, handing power to people and edging us towards a purer democracy.
    Today, no one questions the wisdom of any of those reforms. I believe that it
    is time for us to take another step towards a purer democracy.</p><p pid="b.937.2/6">In
    the past few years, our world has changed beyond recognition. We have access to
    instant news from tens of thousands of different sources. Anyone can create a
    media platform and become a media baron. We no longer depend on a small handful
    of newspaper proprietors to inform our politics. Whereas voters used to rely on
    the odd newsletter and occasional newspaper report to find out about their MP,
    today&#8217;s voters can see in real time what their MP is saying and doing, and
    whether and how they are voting.</p><p pid="b.937.2/7">While those vast changes
    have taken hold, the way in which we do democracy has stood still. We still have
    a system in which, once elected, an MP is almost entirely insulated from any pressure
    from his or her constituents until five years or so later in the next general
    election.</p><p pid="b.937.2/8">There is no mechanism that allows voters to sack
    their MP. An MP can switch to an extreme party, systematically break each and
    every promise that they made before the election, refuse to turn up in Parliament
    or refuse to engage in any meaningful sense with their electorate, but unless
    they are jailed for more than 12 months an MP is effectively unmoveable. It is
    therefore no surprise that, from the moment an election is over, the pressure
    is all top-down from the party, not bottom-up from the constituents.</p><p pid="b.937.2/9">In
    the heat of the expenses scandal, the leaders of all three mainstream parties
    seemed finally to understand the full extent of the public disillusionment with
    politics. Perhaps in a panic, they came up with a powerful idea: they promised
    to bring in a system of recall that would allow voters to hold their MPs to account
    at all times. That was a straightforward promise and recognition of the problem
    that showed a willingness to trust voters and to treat them as grown-ups.</p><p
    pid="b.937.2/10">However, now that the Deputy Prime Minister has been asked to
    produce a recall Bill, he has come up with an idea that is so far removed from
    genuine recall that it is recall only in name. It is an attempt to convey an impression
    of democratic reform without empowering voters in any sense at all. I am yet to
    find anyone inside or outside Parliament who supports the Government Bill.</p><p
    pid="b.937.2/11">True recall is a very simple mechanism. If a percentage of constituents&#8212;usually
    around 20%&#8212;sign a petition in a given time frame, they earn the right to
    have a referendum in which voters are asked whether they want to recall their
    MP. If more than half of the voters say yes, there is a subsequent by-election.
    By contrast, under the Government&#8217;s proposals, power will move up, not down,
    and to a parliamentary Committee, not to voters. The Committee on Standards&#8212;whose
    Chairman, incidentally, has already said that he does not want these extra powers&#8212;would
    determine, using extraordinarily narrow criteria, whether an MP qualified for
    recall. If that happened, there would be no recall referendum in which Members
    could defend themselves against whatever charges had been raised. There would
    effectively be an immediate by-election, fought in the national context. No Member,
    good or bad, would stand a chance under that process, not least because no association
    would be crazy enough to reselect a Member once the Committee had pointed its
    finger.</p><p pid="b.937.2/12">Instead of bringing in reforms to empower people
    to hold this institution to account, which was what all three parties promised,
    the Government want to introduce a system that empowers the institution to hold
    itself to account. Given that, I say good luck to the mavericks, the independent-minded
    MPs who are here on their own without the protection of party. Let us be clear
    that under the Government&#8217;s plans, an MP could refuse to perform any one
    of the functions required of them and still not qualify for recall. If the Government
    push ahead with the proposal, it will merely confirm all the prejudices that people
    have about politics. Voters will see that despite all the promises, they have
    not been empowered at all, they have been duped.</p><p pid="b.937.2/13">Perhaps
    putting it more politely than I have, the Political and Constitutional Reform
    Committee examined the Government&#8217;s Bill and said that their version of
    recall would</p><p pid="b.937.2/14">&#8220;reduce public confidence in politics
    by creating expectations that are not fulfilled.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.937.2/15">The
    Deputy Prime Minister has explained why the Government want a form of recall that
    is not actually recall, repeatedly expressing fears about what he describes as
    kangaroo courts. However, he must understand that, under a recall system, the
    only court is the constituency and the only jurors his constituents. It is true,
    of course, that there could be vexatious attempts to collect enough signatures
    to get rid of a decent MP, but in the average constituency the threshold would
    be about 15,000 voters. By contrast, most local parties would consider themselves
    lucky if they had more than 500 members. If 15,000 of my constituents signed a
    petition demanding my recall, I would feel a little silly trying to blame it on
    my opponents locally.</p><p pid="b.937.2/16">It is worth pointing out that recall
    already happens all over the world. It is not a novel idea, and it happens in
    its purest form. As far as I am aware, nowhere are there any examples at all of
    successful vexatious recall campaigns. In truth, the arguments against genuine
    recall, when we boil them down, are arguments against democracy itself.</p><p
    pid="b.937.2/17">For voters, of course recall makes sense. It would allow them
    to keep their MPs on their toes, even those in safe seats, and give them a much-needed
    sense of ownership over their democracy. However, I maintain that true recall
    is in our interest too, because it would begin the process of healing the broken
    relationship between people and power. In a true democracy, it would make no sense
    for voters to dismiss Parliament with the sweeping generalisations that are so
    normal today, because in such a democracy people would truly have the MP they
    deserved. If they were unhappy with their representative, they would have no one
    to blame but themselves.</p><p pid="b.937.2/18">Some years ago my hon. Friend

    pwmotiontext="yes">The amendment would give the Secretary of State power to apply
    the emissions performance standard&#8212;EPS&#8212;to any existing fossil fuel
    power station that fits the pollution clean-up equipment that is needed to meet
    the tighter limits, set by the industrial emissions directive from January 2016,
    on emissions of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. Under that directive, plants that
    do not fit clean-up equipment will from January 2016 be subject to a 17,500 hour
    limit on their operation, after which they must close, or, from mid-2020 be limited
    to just 1,500 hours of operation a year. The intention behind the amendment is
    to use the EPS as a regulatory tool for limiting carbon emissions from any existing
    coal-fired power station that is not otherwise forced to close and/or have its
    operation limited under the directive.</p><p pid="b.942.4/3">First, the Government
    do not consider that power to be necessary. Secondly, the measure risks deterring
    any investment in equipment needed to comply with the directive, the consequences
    of which could be detrimental to consumers. I remind the House that the EPS is
    intended to support the planning requirement that any new coal-fired power station
    must be equipped with carbon capture and storage. The EPS is, therefore, about
    ensuring no new unabated coal, and is a clear and unambiguous regulatory measure
    that signals our commitment to decarbonisation.</p>

    class="" pid="c.328.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes that the Government
    has failed to tackle the acute housing shortage which is central to the cost of
    living crisis and over the last three years has presided over the lowest level
    of new homes built since the 1920s, with home ownership falling, rents at record
    highs and rising faster than wages and a record five million people in the queue
    for social housing; further notes that net housing supply under this Government
    has fallen to its lowest level since records began, and that affordable housing
    supply dropped in the last year by 26 per cent, homes built for social rent dropped
    to a 20-year low, while there has been a 104 per cent increase in in-work housing
    benefit claimants since 2009; believes that the Government should take action
    to tackle the housing shortage; and calls on the Government to boost housing supply
    by reforming the development industry and introducing measures to tackle landbanking,
    bringing forward plans to deliver a new generation of New Towns and Garden Cities
    and giving local authorities a new right to grow to deliver the homes their communities
    need.</p><p pid="c.328.1/3">Before I begin, let me say that I thought that Mr
    Speaker spoke for all of us earlier in his eloquent and moving tribute to our
    dear friend and comrade Paul Goggins. His death is a tragedy. He was as decent,
    compassionate, principled and, I have to say, cheerful a man as one could have
    the privilege to meet, and we will miss him dreadfully. Our hearts go out to Wyn
    and to their three children, Matthew, Theresa and Dominic.</p><p pid="c.328.1/4">The
    fact that we face a housing crisis is common ground across the House. Why do we
    face that crisis? Because people are living longer and staying in their own homes,
    which is a good thing; because our population is rising; because every relationship
    breakdown increases the demand for housing; but principally because, as a society,
    we have not been building enough homes. Whether we look at starts, completions
    or net housing supply, the failure to build over the past three years could not
    be more starkly obvious.</p><p pid="c.328.1/5">It is good to see the Secretary
    of State taking part in today&#8217;s debate. By my count, he has participated
    in at least four major housing launches, and his Department has made nearly 400
    announcements about housing in the past three years. I have brought some of them
    along. They are headed &#8220;Building more homes&#8221;, &#8220;Welcome rise
    in affordable housing&#8221;, &#8220;Plans to boost UK housebuilding&#8221;, and
    &#8220;Prevention is best cure for homelessness&#8221;. This is the question that
    the Secretary of State should answer: is he proud of his record over those three
    years?</p><p pid="c.328.1/6">The Secretary of State&#8217;s Department tells us
    that an average of 232,000 new households will be formed in England each year
    over the next two decades. However, in the three years for which he has been in
    charge, the number of homes completed in England has fallen to its lowest level
    since Stanley Baldwin was first Prime Minister. The number of affordable homes
    built fell by 29% last year, and the number of social homes built fell to its
    lowest level for more than 20 years.</p>'

    to this Government, who passed the European Union Act 2011 to ensure that no treaty

    Parliamentary scrutiny of European measures is a matter of lively debate at the
    moment, and I am delighted to see so many of my colleagues who are experts on
    European matters present in the Chamber this afternoon. I am also delighted that
    it is this Government who have given Members of both Houses the chance to decide
    whether to approve such measures. I note that the Bill was debated in the other
    place, which is renowned for its scrutinising abilities, for precisely 37 minutes.
    The German Parliament carried out similar scrutiny before approving the measure&#8212;its

    Bills presented, and for every week that has passed since it was first printed,
    it has become more relevant. There is tremendous public concern about this matter.
    The Bill would make</p><p pid="a.1138.2/4">&#8220;provision to restrict the entitlement
    of non-UK citizens from the European Union and the European Economic Area to taxpayer-funded
    benefits.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.1138.2/5">Last week, the front page of <i>The Sunday
    Times </i>carried a big headline reading, &#8220;Ban migrant welfare for two years&#8221;.
    Those were the words of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, who was
    quoted in the article as saying:</p><p pid="a.1138.2/6">&#8220;Britain should
    be able to say to a migrant: &#8216;Demonstrate that you are committed to the
    country, that you are a resident and that you are here for a period of time and
    you are generally taking work and that you are contributing&#8230; At that particular
    point&#8230;it could be a year, it could be two years, after that, then we will
    consider you a resident of the UK&#8217;&#8221;.</p><p pid="a.1138.2/7">Unfortunately,
    what my right hon. Friend says does not accord with EU law, so it was no surprise
    to read the brief on my Bill produced by the policy research unit, which referred
    to the quote from the Secretary of State, but then said:</p><p pid="a.1138.2/8">&#8220;However,
    this is not Government policy. Sources close to Mr Duncan Smith stressed he was
    expressing an aspiration for the future, rather than spelling out a policy.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="a.1138.2/9">That is the problem. Senior politicians, whether it be the Prime
    Minister, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions or
    even the Deputy Prime Minister, can beat their chests and say, &#8220;The present
    state of affairs, with EU migrants coming here and sponging off our taxpayer-funded
    benefits system, is unacceptable&#8221;, but when one looks at the detail, one
    sees that despite their huffing and puffing, they cannot do anything about it,
    except perhaps for the first three months that somebody is here, which his no
    big deal. Once someone from another EU country has been here for more than three
    months, they effectively have as much access to our benefits system as you or
    me, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>'

    have passed since its resolution on pub companies of <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-12">12
    January 2012</phrase>; remains of the view that the Business, Innovation and Skills
    Committee was right to state in its Fourth Report, on Consultation on a Statutory
    Code for Pub Companies, HC 314, that only a statutory code of practice which included
    a mandatory rent-only option for pub companies which own over 500 pubs, an open
    market rent review and an independent adjudicator would resolve the contractual
    problems between the big pub companies and their lessees; further notes that pub
    closures are increasing, and believes that the Government should by July 2014
    bring forward legislative proposals to introduce a statutory code of practice
    of the kind recommended by the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee.</p><p
    pid="a.160.3/3">For many Members, January in Parliament means two things. First&#8212;for
    some&#8212; it means the worthy, if somewhat joyless, challenge of a dry month,
    and secondly, it means a parliamentary debate about pubs.</p><p pid="a.160.3/4">This
    is the third January in a row during which the House has debated the regulation
    of pub companies. We know that pubs in our local communities are among our constituencies&#8217;
    most precious assets, and a quick trawl through the press releases expressing
    MPs&#8217; dismay at the fact that much-loved pubs in their area face closure
    will reveal immediately what an emotive issue this is, and how passionate our
    constituents feel about it.</p><p pid="a.160.3/5">I know that Members on both
    sides of the House will agree that, economically, socially and culturally, pubs
    are part of the fabric of our great nation. As well as being community hubs, they
    make a huge contribution to our fragile economy. Each pub employs an average of
    10 people&#8212;often young people; often women, including working mums&#8212;who
    are finding it particularly hard to obtain other work. When a pub closes, its
    local economy loses about &#163;80,000. More widely, the production and</p><p
    pid="a.160.3/6">sale of beer contributes about &#163;19 billion to the United
    Kingdom&#8217;s GDP, and generates total taxation revenues of &#163;10 billion
    each year.</p><p pid="a.160.3/7">Given that a wide body of experts and more than
    27,000 other people signed the 38 Degrees petition on pubco reform in just four
    days, today is one of those&#8212;some would argue&#8212;all too rare occasions
    in an MP&#8217;s life when he can vote for something that is both popular and
    right. In the last decade, our expectations of our locals have changed, and consumers
    now rank food higher than beer or sociability among their reasons for choosing
    a pub. As I know there is so much common ground between many Members across the
    House, I shall argue the case for reform in as unpartisan a way as I am capable
    of<i>. [Laughter.]</i></p>

    leave the country, and know that they must do so; by streamlining the appeals
    system to reduce the scope for playing the system; by ensuring that foreign criminals

    We will also strengthen the enforcement of penalties for employers of illegal
    workers. The Bill reinforces controls to counter sham marriages and sham civil

  full_motion_speech: "<p class=\"\" pid=\"b.869.2/1\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">I beg
    to move,</p><p class=\"\" pid=\"b.869.2/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That leave be
    given to bring in a Bill to establish the right of persons in receipt of housing
    benefit and universal credit in the social housing sector to receive said benefits
    at regular intervals; to provide that such persons should not be financially penalised
    in relation to the number of bedrooms in a residence; and for connected purposes.</p><p
    pid=\"b.869.2/3\">I would hope that my Bill would receive support from Members
    in all parties. It is an olive branch for those who, perhaps wrongly, underestimated
    the real consequences of walking through the Government Lobby to support the introduction
    of the bedroom tax. Perhaps I am being too generous in saying that, but the alternative&#8212;that
    those who supported the introduction of the bedroom tax knew fully of the dire
    consequences it would have on those affected&#8212;quite frankly beggars belief.
    Make no mistake about it, the full and sole intention of this Bill is to sweep
    away the dreaded bedroom tax. It seeks to restore justice for up to 660,000 people&#8212;some
    of our country&#8217;s most vulnerable citizens, two thirds of whom are disabled.
    They have been inhumanely let down by the Government's reforms to housing benefit
    in the social sector. The tax has caused heartache and devastation to thousands
    of residents up and down this country. It is a tax whose forced implementation
    has put extreme pressure on councils, housing associations and social landlords.
    It is a tax that has put extreme pressure on the ordinary working people who are
    forced to deal with those unable to move and those unable to pay.</p><p pid=\"\
    b.869.2/4\">On the introduction of the tax, Ministers argued that the changes
    would encourage people to downsize to smaller properties and, in doing so, help
    to cut the &#163;23 billion annual bill for housing benefit; would free up living
    space for overcrowded families; and would encourage people to get jobs. Significantly,
    it has achieved none of those objectives. At the same time, the Department for
    Work and Pensions has trumpeted the measure as, &#8220;returning fairness to housing
    benefit.&#8221; The words &#8220;fairness&#8221; and &#8220;bedroom tax&#8221;
    should not be uttered in the same sentence.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/5\">This tax is
    a problem in each and every constituency up and down the country; this is not
    simply a problem in Labour-dominated authorities. I was contacted only last week
    by a distraught resident from the Tory shires who is hoping that my Bill will
    be successful, because he, a disabled man, is living in a three-bedroom property
    and has just received an eviction notice for bedroom tax arrears. He is not alone.
    The bedroom tax sufferers in Liberal Democrat and Tory constituencies number around
    250,000. Perhaps we should ask them whether they think this abominable tax has
    restored fairness to housing benefit.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/6\">My Bill seeks to
    restore fairness and to end the misery that the bedroom tax has caused. There
    are hundreds if not thousands of appalling examples of suffering. There was the
    mother of two who suffered a crippling illness. She committed suicide after realising
    that she could not pay the bedroom tax. Her family received correspondence later
    saying that she should have been exempt from paying the tax.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/7\"\
    >A widow, aged 59, pleaded with the Prime Minister not to force her to move. Her
    husband&#8217;s ashes had been buried in the garden under the rose bushes that
    she had been given by her friends at the funeral. She did not have a disability
    or health problems, but this was a family home for goodness&#8217; sake, and that
    means something. A home is where people bring up their children and cry tears
    of joy. In this case, there were many tears of sadness when the husband unfortunately
    passed away.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/8\">This next case is hard to comprehend; it
    really is difficult to try to get to grips with. The family of the 1999 child
    of courage who spent years battling multiple cancers is suffering at the hands
    of this horrible reform. These people are not living a life of luxury in palatial
    properties; they are living in a place in which they feel safe and which they
    call home. It is time to listen. I am sure that most fair-minded individuals would
    agree that a bedroom is not spare when carers sleep in it, when couples use it
    because one of them has health problems and they cannot share a bed, or when it
    houses vital medical equipment, yet this indiscriminate tax deems it so.</p><p
    pid=\"b.869.2/9\">The reality is that yet another measure introduced by this Government
    is in total and utter chaos. It lies in tatters, with the victims left to pick
    up the pieces. As thousands suffer, there is a real risk that the bedroom tax
    will end up costing more than it saves. The National Housing Federation has said
    that the savings claimed by the Government are &#8220;highly questionable&#8221;,
    partly because those who are forced to move to the private rented sector will
    end up costing more in housing benefit.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/10\">Surely, as politicians
    and members of the general public, we are entitled to question the motives behind
    the introduction of the bedroom tax. The tax does not deal with the problem of
    under-occupation. In fact, the Government&#8217;s costings on the yield raised
    from the bedroom tax explicitly assume that people will not move into smaller
    properties. There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move
    into.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/11\">Some 180,000 households were deemed to be under-occupying
    two-bedroom homes, yet only 85,000 one-bedroom homes became available during the
    whole of 2012. The savings projections of the Department for Work and Pensions
    assume that not one of the 660,000 households affected would respond to the policy
    by moving to a smaller home. Put simply, this is yet another example of the Government
    balancing the books on the backs of the disabled and the vulnerable. The tax must
    be scrapped now.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/12\">Housing associations say that tens of
    millions of pounds are likely to be lost through the build-up of arrears. Reports
    this morning estimate that 144,000 people have fallen behind with their rents
    since the introduction of the bedroom tax and that 14% have received eviction
    notices. Was that really meant to happen? Was this eviction of the poor really
    the plan of the Government?</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/13\">In October, research by the
    University of York, which was based on data by the housing associations that have
    tenants affected by the bedroom tax, suggested that the policy could save up to
    39% less than the DWP had predicted. In the past week, it has emerged that more
    than half of the &#163;500 million that the Government claim will be saved by
    the hated tax will be spent on re-housing disabled people. These are vulnerable
    people who already live in properties that have been adapted</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/14\"\
    >for their needs and who have built up local support networks with their friends,
    family and neighbours. The future for them lies in communities that are unknown
    and foreign to them. They have been cast out like the proverbial dog in the night.</p><p
    pid=\"b.869.2/15\">In the past months, it has emerged that a loophole in policy
    exempts thousands of people. Instead of looking at that loophole&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i>
    It is suggested that that loophole has been closed. As Ministers scramble to mop
    up the mistakes, another challenge to the hated tax has arisen. A judge has overturned
    the tax in the case of a Rochdale man who argued that one of his bedrooms was
    used as a dining room. The appeal was upheld on the basis that the dictionary
    definition of a bedroom is a room that contains a bed that is used for sleeping
    in. An avalanche of appeals is on its way.</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/16\">I am proud
    to see that, only last week, the Scottish Labour party shamed the Scottish National
    party into abolishing the bedroom tax. I must put it on the record that I am also
    proud that one of the first acts of a future Labour Government will be to end
    this full frontal attack on the vulnerable. However, we cannot afford to wait
    until the general election of 2015. I urge the supporters of this tax to think
    again. The question is this: are they happy to see the misery and social disruption
    of the vulnerable and disabled?</p><p pid=\"b.869.2/17\">I began this speech by
    expressing the view that those who voted in favour of introducing this dreaded
    bedroom tax may have underestimated the human suffering that it would cause. That
    is no longer in any doubt, so I urge them all to do the honourable thing and support
    my Bill.</p>"

    The matter before us takes us to the heart of this Government&#8217;s shabby and
    shameful record. By statutory instrument, the Government are trying to close a
    loophole in the bedroom tax legislation without even understanding how many people
    are affected by these changes. Instead of trying to close this loophole, the Government
    should finally try to do the right thing and scrap the bedroom tax altogether.
    This Government promised that they would not balance the books on the backs of
    the poorest and most vulnerable, but that is exactly what they are doing, and
    in such a careless, clumsy and cack-handed way that we see chaos, confusion and

    affected, many of whom are already below the poverty line and forced, as a result
    of this tax, to find an average &#163;728 a year extra in rent&#8212;equivalent
    to losing all the child benefit for a second child. So much for the Prime Minister&#8217;s

    class="" pid="b.456.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that the
    pilot badger culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset have decisively failed against
    the criteria set out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
    in guidance to Natural England for licensing of the culls, which stipulated that
    70 per cent of the badger population should be culled within a six-week period;
    notes that the costs of policing, additional implementation and monitoring, and
    the resort to more expensive cage-and-trap methods over an extended period have
    substantially increased the cost of the culls, and strengthened the financial
    case for vaccination; regrets that the decision to extend the original culls has
    not been subject to any debate or vote in Parliament; further regrets that the
    Independent Expert Panel will only assess the humaneness, safety and effectiveness
    of the original six-week period and not the extended cull period; and urges the
    Government to halt the existing culls and granting of any further licences, pending
    development of alternative strategies to eradicate bovine TB and promote a healthy
    badger population.</p><p pid="b.456.2/3">I thank you for your gracious comments,
    Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sure that the debate will be very well attended and,
    bearing that in mind, I hope that colleagues will accept that I will not be taking
    any interventions during my opening remarks. I know that the many right hon. and
    hon. Members here today will make this a lively and impassioned debate.</p><p
    pid="b.456.2/4">This is a timely debate, coming before any further roll-out of
    the culls, and particularly in the light of concerns being raised from many quarters
    about the culls. I am grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for granting
    a full day&#8217;s debate and vote on the Floor of the House. I have received
    a large amount of cross-party support for this debate. It is important to note
    that this is not a matter of one side of the House versus the other. The House
    wants a chance to vote on this issue and I have made repeated calls for it to
    be brought back before the House. I tabled my first early-day motion on <phrase
    class="date" code="2014-06-25">25 June</phrase> last year calling for the matter
    to return, and 149 Members from both sides of the House supported it. I then tabled
    another on <phrase class="date" code="2014-10-31">31 October</phrase> asking for
    a return, which attracted 107 Members. In a well-attended Westminster Hall debate
    on 11 Dec, I pleaded with the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and
    Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40141"
    name="George Eustice">the Member for Camborne and Redruth (George Eustice)</phrase>,
    to bring the matter back before the House. Well, I have brought it back, with
    the support of many colleagues of all political parties. I hope that colleagues
    today will examine their consciences and try to do the right thing. I know that
    this is not an</p><p pid="b.456.2/5">easy subject, and that feelings are running
    high on both sides, but we must not be seen just to be doing something, if we
    are now convinced that the facts and evidence indicate that we might have taken
    the wrong approach.</p>

    spending. I am conscious that this is a time-limited debate and will keep my remarks
    brief so that others can speak. The welfare cap marks an important moment in the
    development of the British welfare state. I believe the public back a welfare
    system that provides fair support for those genuinely in need and that supports
    those who have a disability and cannot work; those caring for others; those on
    maternity or paternity leave; and those who have lost a job and are trying hard
    to find work. The public, through their taxes on that hard work, are willing to
    pay for that support. It is a level of support that a country such as ours&#8212;we
    now have a growing economy&#8212;can afford to give.</p><p pid="a.374.1/4">However,
    that is not the welfare state we inherited in 2010. That welfare state was not
    fair and not affordable. It was not fair that some received &#163;50,000, &#163;60,000
    or up to &#163;100,000 in housing benefit, paid for by taxpayers who could never
    dream of affording homes with rents that big, so we capped housing benefit payments
    at just over &#163;20,000 a year.</p>

    and to ask the House whether this is really the top priority and the best way
    to spend &#163;50 billion of taxpayers&#8217; money. I started as a nimby, but
    over time I have come to look at this project and I do not believe it is the answer
    to the UK&#8217;s transport issues.</p><p pid="a.582.2/6">Let us consider some
    of those issues. Originally, the costs totalled about &#163;20 billion, yet they
    have now doubled to &#163;42.6 billion and we should not forget that that does
    not include the trains, which are budgeted at &#163;7.5 billion. An apparent leak
    from the Treasury to the <i>Financial Times </i>estimated that the costs as they
    stand could run to &#163;73 billion or more. In fact, such high risks are attached
    to the project, that the contingency is &#163;14 billion. We are now on the fifth
    business case for phase 1 and the benefit-cost ratio is now 1.4, so for every
    &#163;1 of taxpayers&#8217; money spent, only &#163;1.40 comes back. If we strip
    away the flawed assumptions and replace them with a more realistic value of time,
    the true benefit-cost ratio falls way below &#163;1, and there would actually
    be a loss to the taxpayer.</p>

    is 120 years since we last built a main line railway north of London. It is even
    longer since, in 1833, this House voted to start what is known as the west coast
    main line. The line was not meant to be a national route; it became one almost
    by accident. It was a railway built with twists and turns to placate landowners,
    for slow steam trains pulling open-top carriages. It is worth recalling that in
    1832 Parliament rejected the initial Bill because some people objected, arguing
    that canals were all we would ever need for long-distance travel. Today, we ask
    far too much of the line. If we were talking about roads, it would be as if traffic
    still had to go up Watling street, as if the M1 and M6 had never been built, and
    we tried to solve our transport needs by just patching up old roads&#8212;a roundabout
    here, a bridge there&#8212;as if incremental change could make all the difference.
    Well, we tried that: we spent &#163;9 billion upgrading the west coast main line
    a decade ago, and most of that work did not even get south of Rugby. Cities and
    towns in the north deserve better. Scotland deserves better. Britain deserves
    better.</p><p pid="a.557.3/3">That is why I stand at the Dispatch Box today to
    support High Speed 2, a new north-south railway line. I do so with much humility
    and not a little trepidation, but also with confidence, because although I wholly
    understand the concerns of hon. Members whose constituents are affected by the
    route, I also know that this is a decision we cannot duck. We have waited long
    enough. The west coast main line can take no more; it is increasingly full. More
    than that, London and the south-east are also increasingly full, caught in a cycle
    of rising house prices, some of the most expensive commercial rents in the world
    and transport congestion, while cities</p><p pid="a.557.3/4">in the north want
    to grow. It is time to help to break that cycle&#8212;time to connect great cities
    such as Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and Liverpool.</p>'

    in terms of the demographics and character of those renting from private landlords.
    Some 9 million people now rent privately&#8212;more than those who rent a social
    home. More than a third of those who rent privately are families with children,
    and nearly half are over 35.</p><p pid="a.318.4/4">Many people who are renting
    privately do so not out of choice but because they cannot get on the housing ladder
    and are being priced out, or because they cannot secure a social home. Private
    renting is not a cheap alternative&#8212;far from it. In fact, it is the most
    expensive type of tenure. On average, people renting privately spend 41% of their
    income on housing, compared with 30% in the social rented sector and 19% for owner-occupiers,
    but that extra expense is not buying greater stability or higher standards. In
    fact, those who rent privately are more likely to live in a non-decent home than
    in any other tenure. We have one of the most short-term, insecure and unstable
    private rented sectors in Europe.</p>

    a strong and efficient system of social security that will be there for them and
    their families, with rules applied fairly and promptly to ensure support goes
    to those who need it and not to those who do not. Instead, the Government are
    wasting more and more taxpayers&#8217; money on poorly planned and disastrously

    will keep my remarks brief, but I would like to remind the House once more of
    the important provisions before us. Finance Bill 2014 delivers measures that will
    help British businesses invest and create jobs, help British households work and
    save, and help to ensure that everyone in Britain pays their fair share of tax.
    The Bill builds on the strong foundations that we have secured in the past four
    years, safeguarding our economic stability, creating a fairer more efficient and
    simpler tax system, and driving through reforms to unleash the private sector
    enterprise and ambition that is critical to our recovery.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/3">Let
    me focus first on growth and competitiveness. When this Government took office,
    we inherited an economy in crisis. We have had to make some tough choices, but
    we have delivered our economic plan. As a result, the UK economy is finally getting
    back on track. The deficit is shrinking, employment is at record levels and the
    our economy grew faster than that of any other advanced economy over the past
    year. To support the recovery, it is vital that the UK tax system attracts investment
    to this country and does everything possible to ensure that UK businesses can
    compete in the global race. That is why, in the corporate tax road map in 2010,
    we set out our ambition to give the UK the most competitive tax regime in the
    G20.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/4">In my conversations with financial directors and tax
    advisers I am told again and again of the importance of a low headline rate and
    the signal it sends. I am proud to say that, as a result of this Government&#8217;s
    actions, the main rate of corporation tax will fall to 20% by 2015-16&#8212;not
    only significantly lower than the uncompetitive rate of 28% we inherited from
    Labour, but the lowest of any major economy in the world. It is vital for our
    national interest that we continue to have that low competitive rate. Altogether,
    by 2016, our corporation tax cuts for small and large businesses will be saving
    businesses &#163;9.5 billion every year. These reforms have been a central plank
    of the Government&#8217;s economic strategy, and that strategy is working.</p><p
    pid="b.1026.0/5">Competitiveness is not just about the rate of corporation tax.
    That is why this Bill will raise the annual investment allowance to &#163;500,000
    with effect from April 2014 to December 2015. This doubles the amount of investment
    on which firms can get up-front tax relief. More than 4.9 million firms will benefit,
    the vast majority of which will be small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/6">The
    Bill will also reduce business and household energy costs by freezing the carbon
    price support rate to &#163;18 in 2016-17. The Government have also committed
    to maintain the freeze until the end of the decade, which will save businesses
    &#163;4 billion by 2018-19. The Bill includes measures to give targeted support
    to the innovative sectors that will drive growth in the 21st century. We will
    legislate further to increase the generosity of the research and development tax
    relief for small businesses, with an increased rate of support for loss makers
    of 14.5%. This demonstrates the Government&#8217;s commitment to supporting research-intensive
    SMEs and start-ups and could support up to &#163;1 billion of investment over
    the next five years. We will support social enterprise with a 30% tax relief,
    unlocking up to &#163;500 million in additional investment over the next five
    years, and we are making permanent our successful seed enterprise investment scheme
    to support investment in start-ups and early-stage firms. Let me mention again
    the new theatre tax relief, which we have just debated, that recognises the unique
    cultural value that the theatre sector brings to the whole of the UK.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/7">With
    low corporation tax rates, support for innovation and help for small business,
    Finance Bill 2014 sends the clearest possible message that Britain is open to
    multinational companies, open to entrepreneurs, open to investors: Britain is
    open for business.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/8">Let me deal with fairness. While the
    Bill supports businesses, it also provides for individuals and helps families
    with the cost of living. We are delivering our</p><p pid="b.1026.0/9">coalition
    commitment to raise the income tax personal allowance to &#163;10,000 and we are
    going further to increase it to &#163;10,500 in 2015-16. By April 2015, a typical
    basic rate taxpayer will be more than &#163;500 better off than under the previous
    Government&#8217;s plans. Taken with previous increases, the Government will have
    lifted over 3.2 million people out of income tax altogether. That is real help
    for hard-working people.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/10">The Finance Bill rewards those
    who want to save for the future. We recognise that people who rely on their savings
    income have seen low returns in recent years. From April 2015, the 10% starting
    rate of tax on savings will be abolished, and a 0% rate will be extended to the
    first &#163;5,000 of savings income above the personal allowance. This will benefit
    1.5 million people, over 1 million of whose total incomes will be below &#163;15,500
    a year. They will pay no tax on their savings income at all.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/11">We
    are delivering our promise to recognise marriage in the tax system by introducing
    a new transferable tax allowance for married couples and civil partners, allowing
    spouses in households where neither partner is a higher or additional rate taxpayer
    and where one partner has not used up the full allowance, to pay tax on up to
    &#163;1,050 less of their income from 2015-16.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/12">Let me
    deal with some of the measures we are taking to tackle avoidance. The vast majority
    of individuals and businesses pay the tax that they owe, but there are some who
    continue to pursue unacceptable ways of reducing and delaying their tax bill.
    This Government are determined radically to reduce both the incentives and the
    opportunities for individuals and businesses to engage in abusive behaviour. This
    Government have taken unprecedented steps to tackle avoidance and abuse. Since
    2010 we have legislated to close more than 40 tax avoidance loopholes, and we
    have made major strategic reforms such as introducing the United Kingdom&#8217;s
    first anti-abuse rule. As a result, the market for tax avoidance schemes is shrinking.
    The number of disclosures of tax avoidance schemes fell by nearly 50% between
    2011-12 and 2012-13.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/13">However, we are not complacent. That
    is why the Bill introduces a new requirement for users of avoidance schemes which
    have already been struck down by the courts, which fall within the scope of the
    DOTAS rules, or which are being counteracted by the general anti-abuse rule to
    pay the disputed tax up front. That will generate nearly &#163;5 billion of revenue
    over the next five years, and ensures that those who knowingly enter avoidance
    schemes will not be able to hold on to the disputed tax. They will have to pay
    up front like most other taxpayers. We are also cracking down on high-risk promoters
    of tax avoidance schemes by imposing minimum standards of behaviour, supported
    by onerous information powers and stiff penalties for those who do not comply.
    Those measures demonstrate the Government&#8217;s continued commitment to swift,
    effective and targeted action to tackle avoidance and aggressive tax planning.</p><p
    pid="b.1026.0/14">The Bill may be substantial, but it contains a number of provisions
    to clarify or simplify the tax system. It contains proposals to simplify the tax
    rules and administrative procedures for employee share schemes, and to merge the
    main and small-profits rates of corporation tax. Those changes will make it easier
    for small businesses to meet their tax obligations, and will give them greater
    certainty that their tax affairs are in order. The Bill also</p><p pid="b.1026.0/15">follows
    a longer, more thorough process of policy development. In December 2013 we published
    more than 300 pages in draft legislation for comment, and we received more than
    300 responses, which have improved the final legislation.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/16">The
    Bill once again delivers on the Government&#8217;s commitment to unprecedented
    levels of consultation and scrutiny in the development of new tax proposals. It
    has also undergone 31 hours of scrutiny in the Public Bill Committee. Let me take
    this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to the Members on both sides of the
    House who served tirelessly on the Committee, as I did not have a chance to put
    all my thanks on record at the end of the Committee stage.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/17">I
    particularly thank the Whips: my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40304"
    name="Amber Rudd">the Member for Hastings and Rye (Amber Rudd)</phrase> provided
    invaluable help, and I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520"
    name="Nicholas Dakin">the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase>. I thank
    my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40281" name="Caroline
    Dinenage">the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)</phrase> for her assistance
    in ensuring that inspiration flowed readily. I thank the members of the Opposition
    Front-Bench team, who probed diligently. We did not necessarily agree, and Ministers
    certainly did not accede to any of their endless requests for reports and reviews,
    but they put their case in, for the most part, reasonable terms.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/18">I
    thank the hon. Members for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood), for Kilmarnock
    and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson) and for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)&#8212;not
    forgetting, of course, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460"
    name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>,
    who at least was there at the beginning and is here at the end. That is half the
    skill of dealing with a Finance Bill, as far as I can see.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/19">I
    thank the Financial Secretary to the Treasury and the Economic Secretary to the
    Treasury for their help in setting out the Government&#8217;s case. I also thank
    my hon. Friends on the Back Benches, whose contributions were generally both valuable
    and brief: I am grateful for that.</p><p pid="b.1026.0/20">I fear that my time
    is almost up, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I shall draw my remarks to a close. The 2014
    Finance Bill rewards hard work, and restores our private sector&#8217;s competitiveness.
    It encourages investment, tackles avoidance, and helps those on low incomes. This
    is a Bill that takes difficult steps but delivers real change, and I commend it
    to the House.</p>'

    my statement to the House last Thursday, I made clear the urgent need for narrow
    and limited legislation on communications data and interception. There is no greater
    duty for a Government than the protection and security of their citizens when
    we face the very real and serious prospect that the police, law enforcement agencies
    and the security and intelligence agencies will lose vital capabilities which
    they need in order to do their jobs. Communications data&#8212;the &#8220;who,
    where, when and how&#8221; of a communication, but not its content&#8212;and interception,
    which provides the legal power to acquire the content of a communication, are
    crucial to fighting crime, protecting children, and combating terrorism.</p><p

    at risk of imminent harm. Interception&#8212;which can take place only in limited
    circumstances, and with a warrant authorised by a Secretary of State&#8212;can
    prove vital to the investigation of the activities of suspected terrorists and
    serious criminals. Without those capabilities, we run the risk that murderers
    will not be caught, terrorist plots will go undetected, drug traffickers will
    go unchallenged, child abusers will not be stopped, and slave drivers will continue

    That the clause be read a Second time.</p><p class="" pid="a.817.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    am grateful to be called at this late hour. This new clause is important. I look
    to the Home Secretary; she knows exactly where I am coming from and where I am
    going. She may believe that we will be defeated on this new clause, but nothing
    will prevent me from making the point, which is that the Bill could become pointless.
    The difficulty, which she understands&#8212;I am sure that her advisers have already
    explained it&#8212;is simply that clauses 1 and 2 will enable the Home Secretary
    to serve a data retention notice on public telecommunications operators and to
    make secondary legislation governing such notices. However, there is real doubt
    that the precise meaning of the European Court of Justice&#8217;s Digital Rights
    Ireland judgment has the effect of potentially eviscerating the Bill.</p><p pid="a.817.2/3">Professor
    Peers of Essex university draws attention to the objection by the Court to the
    requirement to retain all communications data. The fact that the directive required
    all data to be retained from all subscribers was indeed the first of the considerations
    taken into account by the Court in arriving at the conclusion that the directive
    was disproportionate. The problem is that it is within the framework of European
    law. This Bill is within the scope of EU law and so is the charter of fundamental
    rights, and the general principle of EU law will continue to apply. What that
    means in practice is very simple: sections 2 and 3 of the European Communities
    Act 1972 have the effect of ensuring that the retention directive, its replacements
    and all that follows from it are and have to be implemented in UK law. The United
    Kingdom also has an obligation under the voluntarily enacted 1972 Act to accept
    the jurisdiction of the European Court.</p><p pid="a.817.2/4">The European Court
    has already adjudicated on this matter, but the problem is that within the framework
    of this Bill there are grave uncertainties that have already been expressed by
    myself and others during the course of these proceedings. The bottom line is therefore
    whether we are to make uncertainty more uncertain by providing for a situation
    in which we enact a Bill that might be challenged by the European Court through
    arrangements that some people who do not like its provisions might decide to entertain.
    If they do so, it will go back through the Court of First Instance and then the
    Court of Appeal before going to our own Supreme Court and being referred to the
    European Court of Justice. As with the Merchant Shipping Act 1988, which was struck
    down by our own High Court in pursuance of the European Communities Act 1972,
    which is a voluntary</p><p pid="a.817.2/5">Act, the net result if the European
    Court of Justice makes such a determination will be that the United Kingdom will
    be faced with this Bill being struck down as enacted.</p><p pid="a.817.2/6">I
    do not need to say any more, because I have made the point throughout the course
    of our proceedings. I implore the Government to take note of the new clause, which
    has been carefully considered by some very senior lawyers, both academics and
    practising lawyers. They are convinced that the Bill is at risk and so, as I did
    with the enactment of the Lisbon treaty, I tabled a provision that said that notwithstanding
    the European Communities Act the charter of fundamental rights would not apply.
    The Home Secretary might smile now, but I have to say to her that that is now
    a serious choice for the Government. Either they except the charter of fundamental
    rights or, through amendment of the 1972 Act, they should ensure that the charter
    of fundamental rights does not apply. That also applies to these provisions and
    I need say no more for the moment. I sincerely trust that the Minister will give
    a positive response.</p>'

    have not been present on Fridays recently and I had forgotten how popular they
    can be. Perhaps we should move a motion to do this more often.</p><p pid="b.550.1/3">It
    was my good fortune to come top of the MPs&#8217; national lottery for private
    Members&#8217; Bills, and a great opportunity it was. Just as we have held the
    Commons prayer that we should be working</p><p pid="b.550.1/4">&#8220;to improve
    the condition of all mankind&#8221;,</p><p pid="b.550.1/5">I felt that an area
    of greatest concern in my constituency, and the area of policy that I would like
    to advance the case for, is that of addressing the desperate need for affordable
    accommodation of very large numbers of the population throughout the country.</p><p
    pid="b.550.1/6">I have been engaged in discussions with many interest groups and
    many colleagues around the House to seek to advance that cause. Indeed, when my
    name came out the hat first, I consulted my constituents and proposed a range
    of ideas. I listened and was bombarded by a large number of proposals for a private
    Member&#8217;s Bill, and I narrowed them down to three: one on health, one on
    devolution and the other on housing. Having consulted my constituents, it was
    clear to me that housing was the most pressing issue they face, especially the
    lack of affordable housing and the poverty caused as the result of policies that
    perhaps need to be adjusted to take account of the conditions in which people
    live.</p><p pid="b.550.1/7">Having had a range of discussions on different aspects
    of the Bill&#8212;it started quite wide and we have narrowed it down&#8212;we
    have come to a proposal that has three elements. Existing tenants will not be
    subject to any housing benefit deduction until they have received a reasonable
    offer of alternative social rented accommodation with the correct number of bedrooms.
    Tenants who need a extra bedroom for genuine medical reasons or whose homes are
    substantially adapted will not have their housing benefit reduced. Clause 3, as
    people will have noticed, will encourage a systematic review of the Government&#8217;s
    efforts to provide affordable housing and, in particular, intermediate market
    housing.</p><p pid="b.550.1/8">I consulted the Public Bill Office, and the Clerks
    were enormously helpful to me in drafting the Bill. They assure me that it meets
    all the requirements of a private Member&#8217;s Bill, including that its primary
    purpose clearly is not to spend money. Indeed, in relation to its housing benefit
    implications, there is a lot of speculation about the likely impact of the Government&#8217;s
    current policy and their policy as amended by the Bill. I am very much reassured
    that the Clerks have given me that support.</p><p pid="b.550.1/9">I mentioned
    that a number of other measures were originally in the first draft of the Bill,
    including placing a cap on the number of second homes by introducing a new planning
    use class. In discussions with a wide range of people, I could not get sufficient
    support for that measure, but I am keen to advance that policy in other ways.
    Another measure was a &#8220;use it or lose it&#8221; approach to deal with the
    problem of large numbers of developers who land-bank, or hold back development
    land, which has the effect of driving up development land prices and therefore
    the ability to build affordable homes.</p><p pid="b.550.1/10">I have promoted
    intermediate market housing for many years. Indeed, in a professional capacity
    before I was first elected, I was engaged in that activity and work. I am keen
    to ensure that we have an opportunity to develop a new lower rung of the housing
    ladder to advance that case. Clause 3, largely through tentative steps, encourages
    the Government to look more urgently at the opportunities that people need to
    address that issue.</p><p pid="b.550.1/11">This is the first coalition Government
    for many years, and I have personally taken the strong view that coalition should
    be relatively easy to do. We should simply get on and deliver the things on which
    we agree and seek compromise in those areas where we disagree; but I am personally
    a strong parliamentarian and I believe that, where coalition parties fail to achieve
    compromise, it is better to resolve the matter here on the merits of the debate,
    rather through backroom deals and matters that are not open to debate in the House.</p>'

    acts of ISIL against the peoples of Iraq including the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Christians
    and Yazidi and the humanitarian crisis this is causing; recognises the clear threat
    ISIL poses to the territorial integrity of Iraq and the request from the Government
    of Iraq for military support from the international community and the specific
    request to the UK Government for such support; further recognises the threat ISIL
    poses to wider international security and the UK directly through its sponsorship
    of terrorist attacks and its murder of a British hostage; acknowledges the broad
    coalition contributing to military support of the Government of Iraq including
    countries throughout the Middle East; further acknowledges the request of the
    Government of Iraq for international support to defend itself against the threat
    ISIL poses to Iraq and its citizens and the clear legal basis that this provides
    for action in Iraq; notes that this motion does not endorse UK air strikes in
    Syria as part of this campaign and any proposal to do so would be subject to a
    separate vote in Parliament; accordingly supports Her Majesty&#8217;s Government,
    working with allies, in supporting the Government of Iraq in protecting civilians
    and restoring its territorial integrity, including the use of UK air strikes to
    support Iraqi, including Kurdish, security forces&#8217; efforts against ISIL
    in Iraq; notes that Her Majesty&#8217;s Government will not deploy UK troops in
    ground combat operations; and offers its wholehearted support to the men and women
    of Her Majesty&#8217;s armed forces.</p><p pid="a.1255.5/3">The question before
    the House today is how we keep the British people safe from the threat posed by
    ISIL and, in particular, what role our armed forces should play in the international
    coalition to dismantle and ultimately destroy what President Obama has rightly
    called &#8220;this network of death&#8221;.</p><p pid="a.1255.5/4">There is no
    more serious an issue than asking our armed forces to put themselves in harm&#8217;s
    way to protect our country, and I want to set out today why I believe that is
    necessary. If we are to do this, a series of questions must be answered. Is this
    in our national interest? In particular, is there a direct threat to the British
    people? Is there a comprehensive plan for dealing with this threat? Is the military
    element necessary? Is it necessary for us to take part in military action? Is
    it legal for us to take part? Will we be doing so with the support of local partners,
    and will doing this add up to a moral justification for putting the lives of British
    servicemen and women on the line? And above all, do we have a clear idea of what
    a successful outcome will look like, and are we convinced that our strategy can
    take us there?</p><p pid="a.1255.5/5">I want to address each of those questions
    head on&#8212;first, our national interest. Is there a threat to the British people?
    The answer is yes. ISIL has already murdered one British hostage and is threatening
    the lives of two more. The first ISIL-inspired terrorist acts in Europe have already
    taken place, with, for instance, the attack on the Jewish museum in Brussels.
    Security services have disrupted six other known plots in Europe, as well as foiling
    a terrorist attack in Australia aimed at civilians, including British and American
    tourists.</p><p pid="a.1255.5/6">ISIL is a terrorist organisation unlike those
    we have dealt with before. The brutality is staggering: beheadings, crucifixions,
    the gouging out of eyes, the use of rape as a weapon and the slaughter of children.
    All these things belong to the dark ages, but it is not just the brutality; it
    is backed by billions of dollars and has captured an arsenal of the most modern
    weapons.</p><p pid="a.1255.5/7">In the space of a few months, ISIL has taken control
    of territory that is greater than the size of Britain and is making millions selling
    oil to the Assad regime. It has already attacked Lebanon and boasts of its designs
    right up to the Turkish border. This is not a threat on the far side of the world;
    left unchecked, we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean
    and bordering a NATO member, with a declared and proven determination to attack
    our country and our people. This is not the stuff of fantasy; it is happening
    in front of us; and we need to face up to it.</p><p pid="a.1255.5/8">Next, is
    there a clear, comprehensive plan? Yes. It starts at home with tough, uncompromising
    action to prevent attacks and hunt down those who are planning them. As the House
    knows, we are introducing new powers. These include strengthening our ability
    to seize passports and to stop suspects travelling, stripping British nationality
    from dual nationals and ensuring that airlines comply with our no-fly lists. And
    in all this, we are being clear about the cause of the terrorist threat we face.
    As I have said before, that means defeating the poisonous ideology of Islamist
    extremism, by tackling all forms of extremism, not just the violent extremists.
    So we are banning preachers of hate, proscribing organisations that incite terrorism
    and stopping people inciting hatred in our schools, universities and prisons.</p><p
    pid="a.1255.5/9">Of course, some will say that any action we take will further
    radicalise young people. I have to say that that is a counsel of despair. The
    threat of radicalisation is already here. Young people have left our country to
    go and fight with these extremists. We must take action at home, but we must also
    have a comprehensive strategy to defeat these extremists abroad.</p>'

    class="" pid="b.162.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to provide that people in receipt of Universal Credit and Housing Benefit
    and accommodated in the social housing sector be entitled to an additional bedroom
    related to caring responsibilities or overnight care; and for connected purposes.</p><p
    pid="b.162.2/3">The Bill would exempt households with one additional room from
    the bedroom tax if a member of the household is entitled to carers allowance.
    It would also widen that exemption to households in which a person needs overnight
    care. Those simple measures would have a significant impact on a group of people
    who deserve support, rather than being unfairly hit financially, as they have
    been by this Government. I fully support my party&#8217;s plans to abolish the
    bedroom tax if elected in 2015, but it is also right that we should focus on the
    impact of the bedroom tax on the financial situation of unpaid family carers right
    now.</p><p pid="b.162.2/4">More than 6.5 million people across the UK are unpaid
    family carers, and they face a host of financial, emotional and practical challenges
    due to their caring. Ignoring that, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members
    of this House voted for the bedroom tax to hit at least 60,000 of those carers.
    Since then, confusion has been caused by Government Members suggesting that unpaid
    carers are somehow exempt from the bedroom tax; they are not. A disabled person
    who needs overnight care from a paid care worker or non-resident relative is exempt
    from the bedroom tax, but where that care is provided unpaid by a partner or another
    carer living in the same house, they are hit by the tax. That is inconsistent
    and unfair.</p><p pid="b.162.2/5">I commend the work that other hon. Members have
    undertaken to try to address the problems caused by the bedroom tax. We have had
    many powerful debates on its unfairness and the impact it is having on our constituents.
    My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40630" name="Ian
    Lavery">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> brought in a Bill to abolish
    the bedroom tax, and the House voted overwhelmingly to support it. <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">The hon. Member for St
    Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> has also sought to secure wider exemptions from
    the bedroom tax for disabled households. Unlike other Members of his party, he
    has fought against the bedroom tax. The House also voted strongly to support his
    Bill, and I wish him success with it, but at the moment I doubt whether Conservative
    Ministers will work with him to allow it through.</p><p pid="b.162.2/6">My Bill
    differs in the fact that it relates specifically to carers. It proposes simple
    measures that would improve the financial situation of carers and their families.
    If it progresses, it would address one of the most unfair outcomes of the bedroom
    tax: the impact it has had on unpaid carers.</p><p pid="b.162.2/7">Subjecting
    carers to the bedroom tax was always illogical as well as unfair. One aim of the
    bedroom tax was to improve work incentives for working-age claimants.</p><p pid="b.162.2/8">The
    Government&#8217;s assumption was that if households were not able to downsize
    they would be able to seek work or increase the number of hours they worked to
    pay the bedroom tax, but for many unpaid carers that is not an option. Entitlement
    to carers allowance means that a person is caring for someone for over 35 hours
    a week&#8212;in effect, full-time caring. These are the carers with the heaviest
    work load. It is not possible for them to move into employment or to seek extra
    hours, as both would reduce their ability to care. Carers UK tells us that 2.3
    million people have given up work to care. For me, it is an insult to carers who
    have had to make the difficult decision to give up work so that they can care
    for a family member to be penalised even further for that decision.</p><p pid="b.162.2/9">The
    Government have suggested that people subject to the bedroom tax could take in
    a lodger, but this is also impractical for many carers. It is inappropriate, in
    my view, to expect a person caring for a family member with a severe disability
    or with many health needs to have to take in a lodger. In any case, the need that
    many carers have is for a separate room so that they can get some sleep. Taking
    in a lodger would mean that the additional room would not be available for them
    to do that.</p><p pid="b.162.2/10">I would like to thank Carers UK for helping
    with the drafting of this Bill. Carers UK and Salford Carers Centre have given
    me examples of the impact of the bedroom tax on carers. I will talk briefly about
    one case from Salford, but Carers UK has examples from other parts of the country.
    If hon. Members talk to carers centres or carer support groups in their own constituencies,
    they will be able to find many similar stories.</p><p pid="b.162.2/11">Mr C is
    a full-time carer for his wife, who has multiple physical health problems. He
    has a demanding caring role that includes personal care for his wife, as well
    as cooking, laundry, shopping, emotional support, and attending medical appointments
    with her. They were rehoused into a two-bedroom social housing sector bungalow
    that is adapted to meet Mrs C&#8217;s needs. Due to Mrs C&#8217;s health problems,
    she finds it difficult to sleep at night and is very restless. Mr C uses the second
    bedroom to get a good night&#8217;s sleep so that he can cope with his caring
    role.</p><p pid="b.162.2/12">When the couple were rehoused, they were eligible
    for full housing benefit, but when the bedroom tax came in they were classed as
    having a spare bedroom. Mr and Mrs C are unable to move to smaller accommodation
    because the bungalow is ideal for them in all other ways. They have applied for,
    and been awarded, several discretionary housing payments that have partially made
    up the shortfall in housing benefit. However, like carers across the country,
    they know that there is no guarantee that any future applications for discretionary
    housing payment will be successful. Carers UK tells me that having to apply for
    discretionary housing payments causes stress to carers and increases their worries
    about household finances. I believe that the case from Salford is typical of the
    situation for many carers.</p><p pid="b.162.2/13">Government policy reflects a
    complete misunderstanding of the circumstances most carers find themselves in,
    and it fails to treat carers with the dignity and the respect that they deserve.
    To address this, my Bill calls for all households with one additional room where
    someone is entitled to carers allowance to be exempt from the bedroom tax. That
    would recognise the</p><p pid="b.162.2/14">contribution that carers make to our
    economy through their caring and their consequent inability to change their financial
    circumstances.</p><p pid="b.162.2/15">The second part of the Bill addresses the
    issue of overnight care. Current exemptions to the bedroom tax fail to recognise
    all those who need an additional bedroom for care needs, because they apply solely
    to the overnight care needs of the tenant or their partner, and only when a non-resident
    provides that care. Those people are denied an additional room if the partner
    or other person living in the home provides the care unpaid. If a disabled child,
    older parent or another disabled relative lives with them and needs overnight
    care, those needs for an additional room are not taken into account either. The
    exemption for disabled children relates only to those who cannot share a room
    with a sibling, not to those who need overnight care. My Bill would address that
    imbalance and widen the exemption to any person in the house who needs overnight
    care, not just the tenant or partner. I know that that anomaly has had a negative
    impact on many carers and their families.</p><p pid="b.162.2/16">I have described
    a case where an additional bedroom is needed by the unpaid family carer to get
    the sleep needed to be able to continue to care. My Bill would make simple changes
    to exempt many carers from the financial burdens imposed by the bedroom tax, and
    help to free them from the uncertainty of relying on temporary discretionary housing
    payments. These are small changes which would have a big impact on unpaid family
    carers, who are already coping with all the challenges of caring. We owe it to
    those carers to recognise the contribution that they make through caring. We owe
    it to them to remove the one financial burden which should never have been imposed
    on them. I urge Members on both sides of the House to support this Bill.</p>'

    name="Richard Drax">the Member for South Dorset (Richard Drax)</phrase> and other
    Members of this House, is to review and repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act
    2011. The Act was passed, of course, in the heady early days of the coalition,
    with many new Members present. This is a good time, after four years, to think
    about it, to review it and, I hope, to determine to repeal it.</p><p pid="a.1069.3/4">Fixed-term
    Parliaments were marketed to us as a restriction on the excessive power of the
    Executive. In reality, fixed-term Parliaments are a restriction on democracy,
    not on the Executive. It was claimed then that a general election called at a
    time advantageous to a sitting Government, or because Parliament clearly needed
    refreshing after, say, four years, was somehow less legitimate than a general
    election held at a fixed time every five years.</p><p pid="a.1069.3/5">Leaving
    aside the point that a democratic mandate is a democratic mandate whenever it
    is held, a Dissolution is forbidden under the Act unless two thirds of the entire
    membership of the House, including any vacant seats, support a motion calling
    for an election. That means that a party or group that has just one third of the
    seats has the power to block a Dissolution and can prevent the Government from
    consulting the people. How is that democratic? I think that undermines the whole
    democratic legitimacy of the Government, whether it is a majority or a minority
    Government. The old system, of course, allowed a Prime Minister to find a route
    out of decisional gridlock. It permitted the Government to consult the people
    on developments which may have been unforeseen at the time of the last general
    election. Governments who found themselves hanging under a parliamentary scandal&#8212;or
    when the economy is going badly or something has gone badly wrong&#8212;had an
    easy route out, and voters could give them their marching orders or return them
    to power.</p><p pid="a.1069.3/6">We have always valued the combination of the
    general election and the first-past-the-post system, because it is, we say, capable
    of producing strong sustainable Governments who can deliver on their promises
    to voters. That has always been our pride. To an extent, we have therefore defined
    ourselves in opposition to other systems which have to form coalitions after general
    elections. I think all of us hope that the present coalition is an aberration.
    Our major political parties&#8212;particularly the Labour and Conservative parties&#8212;are,
    of course, coalitions in themselves, formed before elections in order to present
    voters with real choices.</p>

    story, the Government want to re-privatise the east coast main line at an estimated
    cost of &#163;6 million. That money would be better spent on improving the service,
    rather than satisfying the Tory obsession with privatisation. Labour is the only
    party with a plan to reform the railways and put passengers first. With this Bill,
    I am very pleased to support the brilliant work of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40462" name="Lilian Greenwood">the Member for Nottingham
    South (Lilian Greenwood)</phrase>, the shadow rail Minister, and my hon. Friend
    <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40625" name="Mary Creagh">the
    Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)</phrase>, the shadow Transport Secretary, who
    have set out the reforms that we need.</p><p pid="a.314.2/6">The next Labour Government
    will review this Government&#8217;s failed franchising process as a priority.
    After the chaos of recent years, we will act to safeguard taxpayer and passenger
    interests by putting in place a system that is fit for purpose. We will learn
    the lessons of the east coast main line, where we have seen the benefits of a
    not-for-dividend operator, by legislating to allow a public sector operator to
    take on lines and challenge the train operators on a genuinely level playing field
    and in the public interest. That will help to secure value for money for passengers
    and taxpayers.</p><p pid="a.314.2/7">As a Co-operative MP, I am pleased that we
    have pledged that the next Labour Government will explore co-operative and mutual
    solutions and the benefits of co-operative principles, and increase the involvement
    of passengers and employees in transport by giving them a much greater say in
    the industry. The Co-operative party&#8217;s reports, &#8220;Rail Cymru&#8221;
    and &#8220;A People&#8217;s Railway for Scotland&#8221;, explore the options for
    Scotland and Wales. As a localist, I am pleased that Labour is committed to devolving
    decisions across all areas of the UK on the running of regional and local services,
    so that areas can bring trains, buses, ferries and trams together into a single
    network.</p><p pid="a.314.2/8">We must tackle the monopoly market for rail rolling
    stock by giving Network Rail greater responsibility for developing a long-term
    plan for the procurement and leasing of new rail rolling stock. We will create
    a guiding mind for the railways by bringing Network Rail together with a representative
    passenger rail body to contract routes; co-ordinate services and skills in the
    industry; oversee stations, fares and tickets; and ensure that there is customer
    satisfaction across the network. We will ease the pressure on fare payers through
    the efficiencies that our reforms release, by capping annual fare rises on every
    route, by simplifying fare structures and by creating a new legal right to the
    cheapest ticket. I know that those proposals will be welcomed by many of my constituents.</p><p
    pid="a.314.2/9">Corby and east Northamptonshire are served by private and public
    sector rail operators. The contrasting experiences of my constituents demonstrate
    the need for my Bill. Corby, which is served by East Midlands Trains, recently
    celebrated five years since Labour opened the new railway station. Corby is the
    fastest growing town in the country. It was once known as the largest town in
    Europe without access to a railway system. Use of the station has doubled since
    it was opened in 2009. It takes 70 minutes on the train from St Pancras. The station
    is a symbol of Labour&#8217;s investment in the regeneration of Corby and it has
    given a big boost to the local economy. It was campaigned for by the former Labour
    MP, Phil Hope, and by Labour councillors, and it was delivered by a Labour Government.
    We are now working to increase the frequency of trains and calling for new northbound
    services.</p><p pid="a.314.2/10">However, we cannot celebrate the fares that passengers
    face. They are way too high and they price out many people. A constituent told
    me the other day that he had a medical appointment in London, but he did not know
    how he would find the more than &#163;100 needed to get there. A Corby to London
    season ticket costs &#163;7,400 and an open return costs &#163;105. Many constituents
    in the east Northamptonshire side of my constituency, such as those who live in
    the town of Oundle or in villages such as Warmington, travel from Peterborough
    station on the east coast line.</p><p pid="a.314.2/11">Although the fares on the
    east coast main line are still high, the rate at which they have increased has
    been hugely different. Since 2010, a standard anytime open return ticket from
    Peterborough to London has increased by &#163;12, or 14%. The equivalent fare
    from Corby on East Midlands Trains has risen by &#163;20 since 2010, which is
    almost twice the rate of increase at 24%. This year, East Coast has raised its
    fares by an average of 1.21%, which represents a genuine real-terms cut in the
    cost of living for passengers. No private franchisee has taken that step. It would
    be fair to say that many of my constituents who use Peterborough station still
    feel that fares are too high, but by comparison, East Coast is keeping fare rises
    down.</p><p pid="a.314.2/12">More than that, East Coast is performing better for
    passengers. It has achieved record passenger satisfaction and punctuality rates
    since 2009. It has introduced almost 7,000 more trains a year, and 500,000 more
    passengers are travelling on the franchise. East Coast has partly funded and helped
    to deliver a major programme of station upgrades, including at Peterborough station.
    It is also performing for the taxpayer, having returned more than &#163;800 million
    to the Treasury.</p><p pid="a.314.2/13">East Coast&#8217;s passengers and the
    employees who have worked to make East Coast a success in public hands will not
    understand why the operator is prevented from taking on the running of other lines,
    let alone why it is banned from continuing to operate the east coast line. Because
    of the Tory rules, we will have a situation where European public rail companies
    can run lines in this country, but our British-owned operator cannot.</p><p pid="a.314.2/14">I
    completely agree with my hon. Friends the Members for Wakefield and for Nottingham
    South that, instead of Tory dogma and an obsession with privatisation, we need
    a different approach that puts the public interest first, that reverses the presumption
    against the public sector and that serves the passenger properly. It is time for
    reform of an industry that sucks up a vast amount of subsidy, and seems loth to
    invest it back into the service of which it is custodian, and that provides little
    redress for passengers stung by ever-increasing fare hikes&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p><p
    pid="a.314.2/15">The Tories and the Lib Dems are wedded to the status quo: only
    Labour has a plan for reforming the railways&#8212;a new model, with a strong
    voice from and control by the people who pay for the railways, the taxpayer and
    the fare payer, and a strong voice for employees who stay working on the railway
    no matter the colour of the uniform or the paint on the trains. The next Labour
    Government will review the failed franchising process; legislate to allow a public
    sector operator to take on the lines; devolve decisions over the running of regional
    and local services; tackle the monopoly market for rail rolling stock; address
    the cost of living by capping annual fare rises on every route; simplify fare
    structures; create a new legal right to the cheapest ticket; and, as Conservative
    Members have shown today, we will do it all in the face of their opposition. They
    are standing up for the wrong people. The Bill is just the first step to a railway
    in which passengers are put first.</p>'

    to reduce the top rate of income tax at a time when working people, who are on
    average &#163;1,600 a year worse off since 2010, are not feeling the recovery
    and while the deficit also remains high; notes that figures from the Institute
    for Fiscal Studies show that, by next year, households will be on average &#163;974
    a year worse off because of tax and benefit changes since 2010; believes that
    a fair plan to balance the books would reverse the cut in the top rate of income
    tax, which is worth &#163;3 billion a year for the top one per cent of earners,
    for the next Parliament, and introduce a lower 10p starting rate of tax; and calls
    on the Government to rule out a further reduction in the top rate of income tax
    on earnings over &#163;150,000 a year.</p><p pid="a.844.2/3">Four and a half years
    into this Government, the squeeze on lower and middle earners is as bad as ever.
    Wages are still failing to keep pace with prices, and the typical working person
    is &#163;1,600 worse off. This is the longest suppression of living standards
    since the 1870s, and my Labour colleagues know that this gap is getting wider
    and wider. This Government are presiding over one of the worst records on income
    growth of any European country&#8212;only Portugal, Cyprus and Greece have seen
    wages erode more severely than we have. For most people, there is no economic
    recovery at all.</p><p pid="a.844.2/4">When the Chancellor was asked, however,
    in a recent ITV news interview why there was no feel-good factor, his answer was,
    &#8220;Well, I simply don&#8217;t accept that.&#8221; Of course, in the world
    the Chancellor and the Prime Minister inhabit life is sweet. Someone lucky enough
    to be in the richest 1% of society has seen their share of the nation&#8217;s
    income grow considerably. Over the past year, the share of the national post-tax
    income of the top 1% of taxpayers&#8212;just 300,000 people&#8212;has risen from
    8.2% to 9.8%, whereas the bottom 90%, a total of 27 million taxpayers, have seen
    their share fall from 71.3% to 70.4%. Those are Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and
    Customs&#8217; own statistics. That most privileged 1% elite have not just seen
    their fortunes grow by chance while others have fallen behind; they have been
    actively helped along by a cut in income tax for those earning more than &#163;150,000.
    The shrinking share of national wealth held by the vast majority when compared
    with the growing share held by the richest does not represent a recovery for the
    many rather than the few.</p>

    been priced off the buses. Bus fares have risen five times faster than wages,
    contributing to the longest cost of living crisis that any of us has ever seen.
    The Government have cut bus funding by 17% in just three years. We must get better

  question: I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for her point of order. As I indicated
    in my explanatory statement before this vote, in which I sought to explain to
    the House the implications of different courses of action, I had been approached
    about debating some matters tomorrow, and I explained what was possible, but no
    determination was communicated to me by Government on that matter. In the circumstances,
    therefore, the proper course is to proceed to the next vote, which flows naturally
    from the defeat of the first motion. I therefore now need to put the Question
    on the draft regulations straight away without any further debate.

    class="" pid="a.983.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House expresses deep concern
    at the impact of the Government&#8217;s policies on Wales; notes the Government&#8217;s
    real-terms reduction of the Welsh budget by &#163;1.5 billion; notes that Wales
    currently suffers from the lowest average rates of pay in Britain and has the
    highest proportion of individuals affected by cuts to social security including
    the bedroom tax; further notes that Wales suffers the highest energy bills in
    the UK and that these, along with low pay, have compounded the cost of living
    crisis in Wales; and calls on the Government to immediately scrap the bedroom
    tax, freeze energy bills and undertake measures to increase pay rates in Wales.</p><p
    pid="a.983.2/3">When devolution was created in 1997-98 by the last Labour Government,
    it was very much intended as a measure to make Wales more accountable, to give
    us a greater level of self-determination, and to see autonomy for the Welsh people
    and bespoke Welsh solutions for Welsh problems. The unspoken motivation behind
    that, especially in Wales where the miners strike was so fresh in our memories,
    was to protect the Welsh people from the prospects of a future Tory Government.
    Pit closures, steel closures, the legacy of de-industrialisation and people shunted
    on to incapacity benefit to languish there for so many years, were fresh in our
    minds, and they were absolutely behind the idea that we would, with devolution,
    have an additional bulwark against the destructive economic philosophy of the
    Tory party.</p>

  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="a.1300.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="" pid="a.1300.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to require the Secretary of State to make Regulations under Section 78 of
    the Equality Act 2010 to require employers of more than 250 employees to publish
    information relating to the pay of employees for the purpose of showing whether
    there are differences in the pay of male and female employees; and for connected
    purposes.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/3">Forty-eight years ago, the women of the Transport
    and General Workers Union at Ford Dagenham got up from their machines and marched
    for equal pay. Today we have the privilege of having some of those women here
    in Parliament. Sadly, they are not here to celebrate a victory won, but to support
    a campaign to deliver on the promises that were made by Barbara Castle and this
    Parliament when we passed the Equal Pay Act 1970. I am ashamed to say that 48
    years on from that historic strike and 44 years since the Act was passed, equal
    pay is still no more than a promise.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/4">Women in Britain earn,
    on average, just 81p for every &#163;1 earned by men. In my constituency of Rotherham,
    women earn just 77p for every male pound. Over a lifetime, that means women miss
    out on a staggering &#163;200,000&#8212;enough to buy a house outright. Young
    women in their 20s, who the Government like to claim do not face the problem of
    the gender pay gap, get paid an average of &#163;1,570 less a year than their
    male peers. In 10 years, that amount will buy them a car or pay for a deposit
    on a house. It is a life-changing amount that young women are denied.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/5">It
    is not just women who are poorer because of the pay gap; it is their families
    too. Equal pay is an issue for all of us. No father, husband or son wants the
    woman they care about to work in a world where they are valued less for being
    a woman. The Government may claim that there is no need to worry and that the
    gender pay gap is falling, but I would hardly call a small fall last year, after
    a widening gap the year before, a victory. It is true that the last Labour Government
    closed the pay gap by almost a third, but even that progress is too slow. Women
    should not have to wait another 44 years for the gap to disappear.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/6">Birmingham
    city council and, more recently, Asda demonstrated that pay inequality&#8212;being
    paid less as a woman for doing work that is of equal value and demands equal or
    even higher skills&#8212;is still a factor for women across the UK. We have progressed
    from the days when jobs would be advertised with one hourly rate for men and another
    for women, but that does not mean that the biases do not continue&#8212;they are
    just more subtle. According to the Chartered Management Institute, the average
    man&#8217;s bonus is &#163;11,000 more than a woman&#8217;s.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/7">The
    inequality becomes self-perpetuating. Men who have earned more in one job enter
    at a higher salary than women doing the same job who are already employed. That
    is justified not by performance, seniority or skill, but by the realities of recruitment.
    Sometimes, as in the case of Birmingham city council workers, there are historic
    pay inequalities that have simply never been rectified. All I am asking for is
    equal pay for equal</p><p pid="a.1300.2/8">work. Whether on the shop floor or
    the trading floor, that principle is as relevant now as it was back when the women
    of Dagenham marched.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/9">Pay transparency&#8212;the simple
    act of a company publishing its gender pay gap&#8212;would mean that these differences
    were public for all to see. Why should the burden be on women to investigate pay
    inequality and to ask their colleagues how much they earn? How can we expect women
    to call out their employer if they do not even have access to the evidence? We
    should not have to wait for whistleblowers. We need to empower women to use the
    equal pay laws that are already in place.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/10">Of course, the
    pay gap is not only about how much workers in the same job are paid. It is about
    equal reward for equal work. It is about valuing people&#8217;s skills and experiences
    equally, regardless of their sex, whether they are a parent or have just returned
    from maternity leave, and whether they are working part time, flexitime or full
    time. It means not only being paid for the job that they do, rather than the person
    they are, but being able to expect that if they do a good job, they will be promoted;
    that they can keep progressing in their career; and that reaching the highest-paid
    role is possible.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/11">The workplace is changing and there
    are many examples of businesses that are committed to breaking down these barriers
    and of women who have made it to the top of their professions. However, today,
    in this very Government, there are 18 men in the Cabinet and only five women.
    In the Chamber, 23% of MPs are women and the majority of those are Labour. The
    Liberal Democrats have not even appointed a woman to the Cabinet in their four
    and a half years in government.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/12">Pay transparency would
    push companies to focus on why the pay gap still exists, whether it is because
    women working on the shop floor are paid less than men in the distribution centre,
    despite doing work of equivalent skill and responsibility; because men in the
    company are getting higher bonuses; or because the highest-paid roles in the company
    are held by men. All those factors require changes to be made to allow equality
    in the workplace.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/13">This is not about naming and shaming,
    about telling companies what to do or about micro-managing them; it is simply
    about changing the emphasis. Pay transparency places the responsibility on employers
    to be actively conscious of the law on equal pay, and to have policies to address
    the gap. It is a simple ask, and we know that because some employers, although
    too few, do it already. PricewaterhouseCoopers recently announced that it would
    join Genesis Housing and the three other companies that publish their pay gap.</p><p
    pid="a.1300.2/14">This is not a vast new administrative burden on employers. It
    would apply only to employers of over 250 employees, and would be as simple as
    publishing the information in the companies&#8217; annual reports. What it will
    do is focus minds. Businesses that already publish their figures tell us as much.
    The insurer Friends Life says that it publishes its pay gap by each pay grade
    for two key reasons:</p><p pid="a.1300.2/15">&#8220;one is trust and the second
    builds on the old adage, &#8216;what gets measured, gets managed&#8217;&#8230;
    This was shown to be the case when we reported a slight widening of our gender
    pay gap at two middle management grades in our 2013 Report. The issue was investigated
    and the explanation included in the report.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.1300.2/16">Openness
    and transparency are principles that this House should be voting for and that
    Governments of</p><p pid="a.1300.2/17">all colours should champion. However, on
    entering Government in 2010, the two coalition parties announced that they would
    not be implementing section 78 of the Equality Act 2010, which the last Labour
    Government introduced to enable pay transparency. The former Lib Dem Equalities
    Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40321" name="Lynne
    Featherstone">the right hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase>,
    made a speech in June 2012 in which she said:</p><p pid="a.1300.2/18">&#8220;I
    firmly believe that for most companies who are trying to do the right thing, voluntary
    business-led initiatives are key. They secure more buy-in and achieve more lasting
    change than the big stick of legislation&#8230; It is not about forcing companies
    to report information they don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p><p pid="a.1300.2/19">The
    Government believed that that passive approach would bring about lasting change.</p><p
    pid="a.1300.2/20">The &#8220;Think, Act, Report&#8221; scheme has been hailed
    by the Liberal Democrat Under-Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, <phrase
    class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" name="Jo Swinson">the hon.
    Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>, as bringing about &#8220;significant
    steps forward&#8221;. However, when asked, the Government admitted that only four&#8212;it
    is now five&#8212;of the 200-odd companies that were signed up to the scheme had
    published their pay gap. That is hardly surprising when the Government&#8217;s
    website for &#8220;Think, Act, Report&#8221; tells companies that they should
    publish information on their gender pay gap only</p><p pid="a.1300.2/21">&#8220;if
    they feel comfortable doing so&#8221;.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/22">That is hardly
    robust encouragement from the Government.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/23">It appears that
    the Liberal Democrats have had a change of heart. They now admit that section
    78 of the 2010 Act was the right approach all along. We still have time before
    the election to make pay transparency a reality. It does not require primary legislation.
    Section 78 already gives the Government the power to make regulations to require
    pay transparency across all large employers.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/24">Finally,
    I want to pay tribute to <i>Grazia</i> magazine and its readers for their fantastic
    campaign, &#8220;Mind the Pay Gap&#8221;, which has seen tens of thousands of
    women sign the petition to enact section 78 for pay transparency. I also thank
    Unite and all the other unions that have championed equal pay for decades for
    the thousands of working women across this country.</p><p pid="a.1300.2/25">Today,
    Parliament has the opportunity to take a big step closer to making good on the
    promise of equal pay, which was fought for and won by the women of Ford Dagenham
    48 years ago. MPs of all parties must listen to the voices of women up and down
    the country and support pay transparency today.</p>

    that following the revelations of malpractice at HSBC bank, which were first given
    to the Government in May 2010, just one out of 1,100 people who have avoided or
    evaded tax have been prosecuted; calls upon Lord Green and the Prime Minister
    to make a full statement about Lord Green&#8217;s role at HSBC and his appointment
    as a Minister; regrets the failure of the Government&#8217;s deal on tax disclosure
    with Switzerland, which has raised less than a third of the amount promised by
    Ministers; welcomes the proposals of charities and campaigning organisations for
    an anti-tax dodging Bill; and further calls on the Government to clamp down on
    tax avoidance by introducing a penalty regime for the general anti-abuse rule,
    which is currently too weak to be effective, closing the Quoted Eurobonds exemption
    loophole, ensuring that hedge funds trading shares pay the same amount of tax
    as other investors, introducing deeming criteria to restrict false self-employment
    in the construction industry, and scrapping the shares for rights scheme, which
    the Office for Budget Responsibility has warned could cost &#163;1 billion in
    avoidance.</p><p pid="d.851.3/3">When citizens hand over their hard-earned cash
    to the Government in the form of taxation, they do so on the basis that at some
    level they have faith in our system of democratic governance&#8212;a system in
    which the Government are entrusted to make decisions about how to use that money
    in the best interests of all their people, and to keep them safe. The collection
    of tax is a core responsibility, and trust underpins the whole structure&#8212;trust
    that if I pay my fair share, so will my neighbour, and trust that the rules are

    fairly to the basic rate taxpayer as to those in the higher band. However, that

    austerity and a series of media disclosures about the low tax bills and complex
    avoidance schemes of multinationals and high net worth individuals have led members
    of the public to question like never before whether, when they pay their tax,
    their neighbour is doing the same. This week&#8217;s revelation that an arm of
    a leading high street bank, HSBC, helped clients to evade and avoid tax using
    Swiss bank accounts has</p><p pid="d.851.3/5">simply added fuel to an already
    roaring fire. It seems that the Government have neither the will nor the ability
    to get a grip on the situation, which is fast spiralling out of control.</p>

    When we cut through the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8217;s rosy view and spin

    and economic change; urge the Government to pursue sensible savings in public
    expenditure as part of a balanced approach and not an ideologically-driven attempt

    to this one. Of course, we should not ignore the fact that he has a fancy new

    rules so that welfare payments go only to those who have contributed to our system,

    EU budget and far greater accountability of the main institutions of the European

    he agrees that we need a comprehensive independent risk analysis of Britain leaving

    and add:</p><p class="" pid="c.1067.1/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House declines
    to give a Second Reading to the EU Referendum Bill because it fails to meet the
    gold standard set by the Scottish independence referendum in terms of inclusivity
    and democratic participation, in particular because the Bill does not give the
    right to vote to 16 and 17 year olds or most EU nationals living in the UK, the
    Bill does not include a double majority provision to ensure that no nation or
    jurisdiction of the UK can be taken out of the EU against its will, and the legislation
    does not include provision to ensure that the referendum vote cannot be held on
    the same day as the Scottish, Welsh or Northern Ireland elections.</p><p pid="c.1067.1/3">I
    congratulate the Prime Minister on his singular achievement&#8212;his 31-day achievement.
    Thirty one days does not seem like a huge amount of time, but in terms of holding
    the Conservative party together on Europe, the last 31 days have been a great
    achievement. Hannibal crossed the Alps in 17 days, but that pales into insignificance
    compared with the 31 days of calm before the Bavarian blunder of yesterday blew
    the gasket on the Conservative party&#8217;s divisions over Europe.</p><p pid="c.1067.1/4">It
    said in <i>The Times</i> today that quoting your own speeches is the first sign
    of political madness. On that basis, the Prime Minister is pretty far gone. I
    want to share with the House the full bouquet of the absurdity, apparently in
    all sobriety, of the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement yesterday. What he said,
    quoted on the front page of <i>The Times </i>today, was:</p><p pid="c.1067.1/5">&#8220;That
    is what I said. I feel that there was a misinterpretation, which is why I woke
    up and read the newspapers and thought: &#8216;I will repeat what I said and make
    that very clear.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p pid="c.1067.1/6">Well, that puts that one
    to bed, doesn&#8217;t it?</p><p pid="c.1067.1/7">At Question Time today, I lost
    count of the number of times the Foreign Secretary started to answer a question
    by saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s very clear&#8221;. I have always had an enormous
    suspicion that when members of the Treasury Bench start their answer to a question
    by saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s very clear,&#8221; we can all be sure that it is
    pretty opaque. Opaque is exactly what the Prime Minister&#8217;s position is right
    now on collective responsibility.</p><p pid="c.1067.1/8">As was said to the Foreign
    Secretary at Question Time, this is not the hypothetical question of whether the
    Prime Minister and the Government will recommend</p><p pid="c.1067.1/9">a yes
    or no vote, although most of us, if we could get a bet on that one, would be pretty
    certain of the outcome. This is the simple question of collective responsibility.
    When the decision is reached, whatever it may be, will it pertain to all members
    of the Government? Will collective responsibility apply?</p>'

    class="" pid="b.1521.3/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes that, 45 years
    after the Equal Pay Act 1970, women still earn on average 81 pence for every pound
    earned by men; welcomes the fact that pay transparency under section 78 of the
    Equality Act 2010 will be introduced in 2016; and calls on the Government to ensure
    that this results in real progress to close the gender pay gap by mandating the
    Equalities and Human Rights Commission to conduct, in consultation with the Low
    Pay Commission, an annual equal pay check to analyse information provided under
    section 78 on pay gaps across every sector of the economy and to make recommendations
    to close the gender pay gap.</p><p pid="b.1521.3/3">The motion stands in the name
    of my hon. and right hon. Friends. May I take this opportunity to welcome the
    new Under-Secretary of State for Women and Equalities and Family Justice? I hope
    she will put her heart and soul into it and I wish her well in the role.</p><p
    pid="b.1521.3/4">It gives me great pleasure to have called the debate today on
    the subject of equal pay. If we boil it down, we see that the cause of equal pay
    is a matter of simple workplace injustice. It is about people&#8217;s basic right
    to be paid fairly for the work they do, to have the opportunity to move up, and
    to be able to improve life for themselves and their families, regardless of whether
    they are a working man or a working woman.</p><p pid="b.1521.3/5">Equal pay is
    a fight that colours the history of the Labour party and movement, from women
    tram and bus conductors who went on strike in 1918, to the women machinists in
    the Ford Dagenham plant. The House first pressed for equal pay in 1944, in relation
    to equal pay for men and women teachers. The Conservative Member for Islington
    East, Thelma Cazalet-Keir, inserted a clause in the Education Bill but it was
    not to be. Churchill was so incensed that he pressured her to withdraw her amendment,
    telling her, &#8220;Now, Thelma. We&#8217;ll have no more of that equal pay business.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b.1521.3/6">Thelma withdrew her proposal, but Churchill agreed to set up
    a royal commission on equal pay. Four years later, that commission warned that
    paying women the same as men</p><p pid="b.1521.3/7">&#8220;may prove disastrous
    in the long run even to young and strong women by heavily overtaxing their nervous
    and muscular energy&#8221;.</p><p pid="b.1521.3/8">Thankfully, times changed,
    and in 1970 Labour&#8217;s Barbara Castle ignored those apocalyptic predictions
    and passed the Equal Pay Act 1970. Until that time, it was commonplace for jobs
    to be advertised with one rate of pay for a man, and another for a woman. The
    Equal</p><p pid="b.1521.3/9">Pay Act outlawed discrimination in pay and is still
    used today by women to challenge such discrimination, but it is not enough. Forty-five
    years on, women still earn on average 81p for every &#163;1 a man earns.</p><p
    pid="b.1521.3/10">Throughout our history, my party has fought for equality. We
    fought for the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which outlawed maternity and sex discrimination;
    child benefit; the national minimum wage; a year&#8217;s maternity leave and the
    doubling of maternity pay; 15 hours&#8217; free childcare; and the right to flexible
    working and paid paternity leave. I am proud that my party cut the pay gap by
    a third during our time in government, but we did not eradicate it.</p><p pid="b.1521.3/11">I
    am sure the Secretary of State will say in her speech that the gender pay gap
    is the lowest on record, but I hope she will also concede that, in the past five
    years, the pace at which the pay gap is closing has slowed. That is why pay transparency
    is important. When companies publish data on pay, they are often surprised by
    how few women are in senior positions or earn the same as their male colleagues,
    and they usually act to change it.</p><p pid="b.1521.3/12">Last summer, we launched
    a campaign for pay transparency, which called for a small but important action:
    that the Government implement section 78 of the Equality Act 2010 and mandate
    big companies to publish their gender pay gap. It is fair to say the Government
    put up some resistance, despite an excellent private Member&#8217;s Bill from
    my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Sarah Champion" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25168">the
    Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion)</phrase>. There was a rally outside Parliament
    led by a truly unusual and exotic coalition&#8212;I am not talking about the Prime
    Minister and <phrase class="honfriend" name="Nick Clegg" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11812">the
    right hon. Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr Clegg)</phrase>. Ex-Bond girl Gemma
    Arterton joined the wonderful Dagenham machinist women, Unite the union members
    and Grazia magazine readers to call for pay transparency. The Government changed
    their stance, and I thank them for having the courage to change their mind, because,
    after all, pay transparency is a pretty humble measure: the simple act of companies
    that employ more than 250 workers publishing their pay gap. That simple step can
    help us to take huge strides towards closing the gender pay gap once and for all.</p><p
    pid="b.1521.3/13">For that to happen, however, the information provided by around
    7,000 businesses must lead to change. Transparency is effective only when firms
    act on the information revealed.</p>'

    final day of the Budget debate, we have heard a great deal about debt and deficit,
    the Budget itself, and the recently released productivity plan. All the Scottish
    National party Members have listened with sadness to the planned cuts, which strike
    fear into our hearts and those of our constituents. I have found myself reflecting
    a great deal on it&#8212;both the conflict of moral principles and the economic
    madness I believe is contained therein. Called out by the Institute for Fiscal
    Studies, this Budget is described as having</p><p pid="b.769.3/5">&#8220;benefit
    cuts at the centre&#8221;;</p><p pid="b.769.3/6">and as a &#8220;tax-raising budget&#8221;,
    the IFS gives the stark warning that,</p><p pid="b.769.3/7">&#8220;unequivocally,
    tax credit recipients in work will be made worse off by the measures in the Budget
    on average&#8221;,</p><p pid="b.769.3/8">and that ultimately it is a &#8220;regressive&#8221;
    budget.</p><p pid="b.769.3/9">We are supposed to believe that the smart economic
    choice is for the UK to eliminate any deficit, pay down all debt, and run&#8212;and
    then sustain&#8212;a surplus. We are fed the yarn that an economy must be in surplus;
    that the gain is worthy of the pain. Despite the concerns of Robert Chote of the
    Office for Budget Responsibility, who described the plan&#8212;somewhat euphemistically&#8212;as
    &#8220;ambitious&#8221;, and the concerns of 77 leading economic academics, the
    Chancellor has ploughed on regardless. Now, I know that a degree in history&#8212;or,
    for that matter,</p><p pid="b.769.3/10">one in music&#8212;does not equip one
    with an instinctive understanding of cause and effect, supply and demand or even
    so-called Micawber economics for that matter, but history does teach us about
    previous economic choices, and that ability to look back provides real accuracy.
    We know how the Chancellor&#8217;s previous predictions failed to meet actuality,
    and we know that the much vaunted current growth has taken place only over the
    past few years.</p><p pid="b.769.3/11">A number of issues concern me today, one
    of which is levels of personal debt. The OBR predicts household debt going above
    the levels of 2008 and reaching an incredible 173% of GDP by 2019. That household
    debt figure excludes mortgages but is based on unsecured lending such as credit
    cards and store cards and, with increasing frequency, payday loans. Fundamentally,
    it contributes to a very real risk of a repeated debt crisis as a direct result
    of the cuts. We have seen a consumption-led crisis before, yet here it is planned
    again. I quote the Chancellor, who said:</p><p pid="b.769.3/12">&#8220;This growth
    is driven by stronger private consumption&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep"
    id="debates/2015-07-08.322"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 July 2015; Vol. 598, c.
    322</phrase>.]</p><p pid="b.769.3/13">There is a small mention in the productivity
    plan about championing enterprise by stimulating finance for small and medium-sized
    enterprises&#8212;but what and how specifically? Simply privatising RBS with the
    mantra &#8220;private equals good&#8221; is frankly not good enough. A lack of
    access to liquidity remains the biggest single issue for small business, while
    at the other end of the spectrum large businesses stockpile their cash. It has
    been asked before but is worth reiterating: where is the support for the challenger
    banks? The cut in corporation tax has been trailed as encouragement for businesses
    to invest, but there is no clear link or evidence to suggest that will happen.
    I would have thought that I would have been intervened on by now to ask what within
    the Budget I agree with, and I confirm that, although I am disappointed with the
    cut in the annual investment allowance from &#163;500,000 to &#163;200,000, it
    is better than what was proposed, which was taking it down to &#163;25,000.</p><p
    pid="b.769.3/14">The continued focus on financial services, in which I must declare
    a previous interest, without rebalancing to improve our exports or manufacturing
    is a worry, particularly where we continue with the models we have adopted. The
    New Economics Foundation has expressed the view that the</p><p pid="b.769.3/15">&#8220;United
    Kingdom has the least resilient financial system among leading industrial (G7)
    nations. It is unusually large and homogenous, highly interconnected . . . highly
    complex and highly reliant on funding from the wholesale financial markets&#8221;.</p><p
    pid="b.769.3/16">I recommend to all Members that they read the foundation&#8217;s
    recent report; its concerns concur with those of many other economists.</p><p
    pid="b.769.3/17">The SNP is urging action so that we can end the unfair anomaly
    whereby Scottish police and fire and rescue services alone are liable for payment
    of VAT. The proposed change to the Budget resolutions would enable us to introduce
    the necessary changes to the Finance Bill. Were this unfair and discriminatory
    situation to be corrected, we could free up an additional &#163;23 million of
    resource for the Scottish Police Authority and &#163;10 million for the Scottish
    Fire and Rescue Service&#8212;money which, I trust, all hon. Members would agree
    could provide welcome funds to support the fantastic work that our emergency services
    do.</p><p pid="b.769.3/18">Our calls for an end to this anomaly have gained cross-party
    support in the Scottish Parliament, and I am disappointed that the Government
    have so far refused to address the disparity in their treatment of emergency services
    north and south of the border. I hope that Members will take the opportunity today
    to take action and put this situation right.</p><p pid="b.769.3/19">We all agree
    that this is about choices, and the choice is how we grow the economy. This must
    fundamentally be by investment. Despite the productivity plan and various Ministers
    suggesting an increase in capital expenditure, a comparison between the Red Book
    of July and that of March 2015 shows total capital spend going down through the
    lifetime of this Parliament. If the Chancellor is unwilling to invest in the UK
    economy, give us the powers in Scotland and we will get on with the job.</p><p
    pid="b.769.3/20">When talk turns to economic and productivity comparisons, we
    hear a lot about the G7, the group of the world&#8217;s largest western economies,
    with which the UK likes to compare itself.</p>'

    That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p><p class="" pid="c.1256.3/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    am conscious of the fact that many people here wish to speak today and that we
    have compressed time as a result of the statements. I will take interventions,
    but I recognise that we need to make some progress so that everybody has a chance
    to speak. In moving the motion, I wish to make it very clear that Conservative
    Members are united in support of the Government&#8217;s aim to move from a high
    tax, high welfare and low wage society to a low tax, lower welfare and higher
    wage society. This Bill lays the ground for that commitment and helps us to continue
    the job of reversing the Labour&#8217;s Government&#8217;s failure that led us
    into the difficulties we inherited.</p><p pid="c.1256.3/3">Let me remind the House
    quickly, before we get into the details, of what we inherited when we came into
    office in 2010: nearly one in five households had no one working&#8212;this is
    what Labour left us; the number of households where no one had ever worked had
    nearly doubled; 1.4 million people had been on benefits for most of the previous
    decade; and close to half of all households in the social rented sector had no
    one at all in work. Since then, even through the coalition, we have proceeded
    to get to 2 million more jobs being created; there are now 2 million more apprenticeships;
    the number of workless households has reached a record low&#8212;it is down more
    than 670,000 since 2010; and the workless household rate in the social rented
    sector is now the lowest on record. The recent Budget debate, in which we had
    a pretty full discussion of many of the characteristics of this Bill, made it
    clear that we want to go further, delivering 3 million more apprenticeships and
    moving towards full employment. These are measures that this Government will drive
    forward and that this Bill requires us to report on each year.</p><p pid="c.1256.3/4">We
    will also continue to bear down on the deficit and debt, achieving a surplus by
    the end of the Parliament. We are spending &#163;3 billion on debt interest payments
    alone every month&#8212;the figure is &#163;33 billion a year, which is &#163;1,236
    per household. Every pound we spend on paying off the debt is a pound we are paying
    to others such as overseas investment funds, rather than on the necessary public
    services such as schools and hospitals or on being able to reduce taxation further.
    Eliminating the deficit and paying off our debts is the moral and most effective
    things for a responsible Government to do for people on low incomes, who rely
    more than anybody on those services.</p><p pid="c.1256.3/5">It is worth pointing
    out that we also need to drive productivity improvements. The Budget contains
    some important measures to make that a reality, and our long-term productivity
    plan sets out how it will boost productivity over the next 10 years. As my right
    hon. Friend the Business Secretary made vividly clear in launching that plan,
    if we could, for example, match US levels of productivity, we would increase GDP
    by 31%&#8212;that</p><p pid="c.1256.3/6">is &#163;23,000 a year for every household.
    A key driver to getting us there is the national living wage. That historic reform
    will give more than 2.7 million people currently on the minimum wage a pay rise
    of more than &#163;5,000 a year. With the increase in the personal allowance to
    &#163;12,500 by the end of the Parliament, the national living wage will make
    work pay and improve people&#8217;s living standards. It will also help productivity.
    The Governor of the Bank of England confirmed last week that the living wage will
    help increase the productivity of workers and of the country&#8212;</p>'

  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="a.1387.3/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p><p class="" pid="a.1387.3/2" pwmotiontext="yes">As
    my right hon. Friend the Chancellor set out in the recent Budget, the British
    economy is fundamentally stronger than it was five years ago. The deficit has
    been halved as a percentage of GDP; for the first time since 2001-02 debt as a
    share of GDP is falling; the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 in 2014,
    and we are expected to repeat that in 2015, too. We have more individuals in work
    than ever before, and wages continue to rise above inflation.</p><p pid="a.1387.3/3">Having
    come so far, we need to stick to our long-term plan for economic recovery. The
    first Finance Bill of this Parliament demonstrates this Government&#8217;s commitment
    to continuing the plan to build a productive, balanced and secure economy, which
    delivers for working people at every stage of their lives.</p><p pid="a.1387.3/4">I
    shall happily take interventions this afternoon, but let me first set out to hon.
    Members the order in which I intend to discuss the measures in the Bill. I shall
    begin by talking about those measures that are intended to support working people
    through the tax system. Next, I shall set out how the Bill will help put the public
    finances in order by tackling tax avoidance, evasion, non-compliance and imbalances
    in the tax system. Finally, I shall talk about how the summer Finance Bill 2015
    will take the first steps in implementing measures to improve the UK&#8217;s productivity.</p><p
    pid="a.1387.3/5">I shall begin with those measures designed to help hard-working
    people keep more of the money they earn, a principle to which this Government
    are committed. We have a proud record on reducing tax for the lowest paid. As
    a result of action taken in the previous Parliament, 27.5 million individuals
    saw their typical income tax bill reduced by &#163;825. This Finance Bill makes
    even further progress, by increasing the tax-free personal allowance to &#163;11,000
    in 2016-17 and to &#163;11,200 in 2017-18. As a result of those changes, a typical
    basic rate taxpayer will be &#163;80 better off in 2016-17 compared with in this
    tax year. Further, the higher rate threshold will also increase from &#163;42,385
    in 2015-16 to &#163;43,000 in 2016-17&#8212;&#163;300 more than the amount announced
    in the March Budget. That will take 130,000 individuals out of the higher rate
    of tax by 2016-17.</p><p pid="a.1387.3/6">It is the firm belief of this Government
    that individuals working 30 hours a week on the national minimum wage should not
    pay income tax. That is why this Finance Bill will enshrine that link in law for
    future increases in the personal allowance. Once the personal allowance has reached
    &#163;12,500, it will always be at least the equivalent of 30 hours a week on
    the national minimum wage. Until that point, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor
    will have a legal duty, when setting the personal allowance, to consider the financial
    impact on an individual working 30 hours on the national minimum wage. This Finance
    Bill also delivers another legislative</p><p pid="a.1387.3/7">commitment to low
    levels of taxation. It introduces aspects of the five-year tax lock by ruling
    out increases in income tax and VAT for the duration of this Parliament.</p><p
    pid="a.1387.3/8">Finally, this Government know that the wish to pass something
    on to one&#8217;s children is the most basic human aspiration. To give hard-working
    people the security of knowing that they can continue to provide for their families
    after they have gone, this Bill phases in a new &#163;175,000 per person transferable
    allowance when a person&#8217;s home is passed on at death to their direct descendants.
    This means that by the end of this Parliament, the effective inheritance tax threshold
    for married couples and civil partners will be &#163;1 million.</p><p pid="a.1387.3/9">At
    the same time, to ensure that those with the broadest shoulders continue to bear
    the biggest burden, this new allowance will be gradually withdrawn for individuals
    with assets of more than &#163;2 million. This reform will be paid for by cutting
    down on the &#163;34 billion that the Government spent on pensions tax relief
    in 2013-14 &#8212;two thirds of which goes to higher and additional rate taxpayers.
    The benefits of pensions tax relief for top earners will be restricted by tapering
    away the annual allowance for those with a total income of over &#163;150,000
    from April 2016.</p><p pid="a.1387.3/10">These are important measures, rewarding
    and supporting the efforts and aspirations of working Britain&#8212;and doing
    so in a fair and balanced way.</p>

    grateful to have the opportunity to move this cross-party motion in today&#8217;s
    Scottish National party Opposition day debate. I urge all Members to look very
    closely at the Order Paper&#8212;I know that that does not always happen&#8212;to
    read the text of the motion and to note a very unusual sight. The motion is co-sponsored
    by the leaders of six parliamentary parties: the Scottish National party, the
    Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green party, the Social
    Democratic and Labour party, as well as the independent Unionist MP, <phrase class="honfriend"

    the Secretary of State for International Development and her Government colleagues
    to the Treasury Bench, I am disappointed, given the cross-party nature of the
    motion and the seriousness of the subject, that the Prime Minister is not here.
    I am sure that many people who care passionately about the need to do as much
    as we can in this humanitarian crisis will be saddened that he did not think it
    important enough to attend today&#8217;s debate. That stands in sharp contrast
    to the all-party approach that we saw last week in Scotland, which included the
    leader of the Conservative party in the Scottish Parliament. That cross-party
    approach to making plans was chaired by the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and
    included charities and others.</p><p pid="a.412.3/5">I do not want to dwell on
    that discordant point, because I would prefer Members, particularly Government
    Members, to look closely at the text of the motion. Perhaps unusually on an Opposition
    day, the motion is not aimed at identifying or highlighting shortcomings in the
    Government&#8217;s policy. Given the gravity of the humanitarian situation and
    the fast-moving nature of developments in recent days, we who have sponsored the
    motion have worked hard in formulating a text to recognise what is being proposed,
    which we all welcome, and to encourage what must happen next.</p><p pid="a.412.3/6">On
    Monday, we had a significant update of UK policy by the Prime Minister, with commitments
    made to help many more people, and we welcome that. The scale of the humanitarian
    crisis is immense. Millions of</p><p pid="a.412.3/7">people have been displaced
    from the conflict in Syria, to neighbours such as Lebanon and Jordan. Many of
    the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been on the move are from other
    war-torn and oppressive countries.</p><p pid="a.412.3/8">Today, the European Commission
    has outlined its immediate plans to deal with the situation, and that does not
    come before time. We are told that it is the time for bold action by EU member
    states and institutions. I note the words &#8220;EU member states&#8221;&#8212;not
    just some of them: all of us, and that includes the United Kingdom. For the world,
    it is a matter of humanity and human dignity. For Europe, it is a matter for historical
    fairness.</p><p pid="a.412.3/9">Europe is a continent where people from nearly
    all countries at some point have been refugees at one time, fleeing war, dictatorship
    or oppression. There is a fundamental right to asylum. It is one of the most important
    international values, and we should not forget that. We should be proud of the
    fact that Europe is seen as a safe haven for those who are fleeing horrific circumstances.
    We should not fear this; we should be proud of it. It is true that Europe cannot
    house all the misery of the world&#8212;we know that&#8212;but we must put things
    into perspective.</p><p pid="a.412.3/10">How can it be that we are hearing from
    all sides, and justifiably so, that we should do everything to combat an insidious
    terrorist movement such as Daesh, but we are not prepared to accept those people
    who are fleeing from it? In the Mediterranean, as the European Commission pointed
    out today, every life lost is one too many, regardless of where those people are
    trying to get to. We know that efforts have been redoubled to dismantle human
    trafficking groups. We learn that fewer boats are under the control of smugglers
    on the perilous route. That is a good thing.</p><p pid="a.412.3/11">We must applaud
    the efforts of countries such as Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon. Those countries,
    which are far poorer than we are, are making huge efforts in moral and financial
    terms. We must recognise, however, that we&#8212;we the United Kingdom; we Europe&#8212;have
    clearly under-delivered in the common solidarity we have offered to refugees who
    have arrived on our territory. Italy, Hungary and Greece alone cannot be left
    to deal with this enormous challenge. This is not a defining matter of whether
    or not one is within the Schengen zone.</p>'

    we are to continue building an immigration system that is fair to British citizens
    and people who come here legitimately to play by the rules and contribute to our
    society, we must ensure that it is balanced and sustainable, and that net migration
    can be managed. When properly managed, immigration enriches this country, as we
    benefit from the skills, talent and entrepreneurial flair that people bring to
    our society. But, as I said in my recent speech, when net migration is too high,
    and the pace of change is too fast, it puts pressure on schools, hospitals, accommodation,
    transport and social services, and it can drive down wages for people on low incomes.
    So we must achieve the right balance, rejecting both extremes of the debate, from
    those who oppose immigration altogether to those who want entirely open borders.
    That is why, since 2010, we have worked to build an immigration system that works
    in the national interest, one that is fair to British taxpayers and legitimate
    migrants, and tough on those who flout the rules or abuse our hospitality as a
    nation.</p><p pid="a.195.3/3">Over the past five years we have taken firm action
    to reform the chaotic and uncontrolled immigration system we inherited, and to
    ensure that people are coming here for the right reasons. We reformed the immigration
    rules for migrant workers and students, while continuing to welcome the brightest
    and the best. We have struck off nearly 900 bogus colleges since 2010, and at
    the same time we have seen a rise of 17% in the number of sponsored student visa
    applications for universities and a rise of 33% for Russell Group universities.
    We transformed the immigration routes for migrant workers and introduced a cap
    of 20,700 for non-European economic area migrant workers, and we have seen an
    increase in sponsored visa applications for highly skilled workers. We reformed
    family visas, to prevent misuse of that route, and we have made sure that people
    can financially support family members coming to the UK. We have also protected
    our public services from abuse by making important changes to the way people access
    benefits and the NHS.</p>

    fiscal policy that we will discuss, and the mechanisms in the charter we are debating,
    the questions before the House and the country are very simple: is Britain going
    to pay its way in the world? Are we going to live within our means and bear down
    on our debts, so that next time disaster strikes we are better prepared? Do we
    have the strength and determination to finish the job that we started of turning
    Britain around and providing security to working families at every stage of their
    lives? Or will we be profligate again and spend money that we do not have, borrow
    for ever, mortgage the future of our children with debts that we could not pay
    ourselves, and consign Britain to a future of high debt, instability and low growth?
    No. Our answer, and the answer in the charter, is that we will put economic security
    first.</p><p pid="a.427.1/4">We resolve to put the livelihoods and living standards

    from the mistakes of the past, not to repeat them, and we choose to put security
    first. After all that Britain has been through, it is remarkable that the proposition
    in this Charter for Budget Responsibility should even be contentious. It states
    that now the economy is growing we should be reducing our exorbitant debts, and
    that we should do that each year by reducing the deficit until we eliminate it
    altogether and run a surplus. Once we have achieved that surplus, in normal times
    we should continue to raise more than we spend and set aside money for when the
    rainy days come. It is as simple as that: we should fix the roof when the sun

    that is being proposed, and the same applies to further stages.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/2\"\
    >The amendments tabled by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ian Lucas\" person_id=\"\
    uk.org.publicwhip/person/11057\">the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian C. Lucas)</phrase>
    raise the issue of Welsh-only votes. In our proposals, we are not talking about
    matters that are still reserved to this Parliament; we are talking about matters
    that have been devolved elsewhere. That is why we believe that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s
    proposals do not stand.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/3\">I recognise the cross-border
    issues that have been raised by Members representing Welsh constituencies. We
    have met previously and debated the matter specifically, but let me emphasise
    that every Member will continue, in legislative terms, to participate in Second
    Reading debates, in Report stages&#8212;when they can table amendments &#8212;and
    in Third Reading debates, as they do now.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/4\">The hon. Gentleman
    mentioned clause 44 of the Housing and Planning Bill. Of course it will be for
    the Speaker to determine the certification of the clause, but it is making a change
    that applies to England on a matter that is already devolved in Scotland, Wales
    and Northern Ireland. That is the information that the Government will provide
    on the clause.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/5\">As for the small number of Divisions,
    I believe that, unlike the last Labour Government, we have kept up the pace of
    devolution&#8212;we have published a Scotland Bill and a Wales Bill&#8212;so the
    issue will come up increasingly in the future.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/6\">The Speaker
    already certifies money Bills and selects amendments. I am sure that he will take
    advice on what should be a technical decision, as he does now. We agree with the
    Procedure Committee that the Speaker should be able to appoint two members of
    the Panel of Chairs to examine that advice, and we modified our proposals accordingly.</p><p
    pid=\"b.1238.2/7\">Let me now say something about Barnett consequentials. Spending
    is voted on through the estimates, which are given effect by law&#8212;by the
    Supply and Appropriation Bill, on which all Members voted. Many individual pieces
    of legislation lead to some changes in funding, but that does not necessarily
    mean that the funding for the UK Government Department changes. It does not follow
    that it has a directly identifiable impact on the block grant to the devolved
    Administrations, so efficiencies in one area could be redirected to front-line
    services without Barnett consequentials. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary
    to the Treasury has written to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"\
    Edward Leigh\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352\">the Member for Gainsborough
    (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase> reiterating that point.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/8\">The
    voting arrangements on the block grant allocations awarded to the devolved Administrations
    are unchanged by the introduction of this process. The Government recognise the
    importance of the House voting as a whole on how money from the Consolidated Fund
    is allocated. That is why the supply estimates process and money resolutions will
    not be subject to this process.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/9\">The funding implications
    of individual pieces of legislation do not exist in isolation. Efficiency savings,
    or indeed additional expenditure, could be connected to one piece of legislation,
    and could be directed back to other front-line services. When we have increased
    spending, as happened with free school meals, we look for efficiencies elsewhere.</p><p
    pid=\"b.1238.2/10\">Scrutiny of the individual supply estimates is mainly undertaken
    by departmental Select Committees, supported by the parliamentary Scrutiny Unit.
    When I was a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, we certainly undertook
    that process. The Liaison Committee then chooses the subjects for debate. Following
    the debates, the estimates are approved by resolution of the House of Commons,
    as has happened in the past. That is why Barnett consequentials are calculated
    on changes to overall departmental spending at spending reviews and why we end
    up voting on the estimates voting process.</p><p pid=\"b.1238.2/11\"><phrase class=\"\
    honfriend\" name=\"Melanie Onn\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25317\"
    >The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Melanie Onn)</phrase> said that this proposal
    adds complexity and will be difficult to follow. What members of the public will
    find incredible is that the Labour party seeks to deny that effective voice to
    the people of England. What our standing orders give effect to is that legislation
    on a matter that is devolved to another Parliament and that affects England or
    England and Wales only requires the explicit consent of MPs representing those
    countries only. My hon. Friends have discussed fairness. As <phrase class=\"honfriend\"\
    \ name=\"Jonathan Reynolds\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24929\">the
    hon. Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds)</phrase> recognised,

    expressed</p><p pid=\"b.1159.3/365\">by hon. Members about the way all this is
    conducted and to respond as positively as possible, notwithstanding the timetable
    commitments in our manifesto.</p><p pid=\"b.1159.3/366\">I should add that the
    reason why we have timetabled votes for 4 pm is that I was aware there were likely
    to be a number of Divisions, and I was particularly concerned to ensure that Members
    from constituencies a little further away could get away to catch planes and trains
    to get back to their constituencies this evening.</p><p pid=\"b.1159.3/367\">I
    will endeavour to keep my remarks relatively short so that all Members who want
    to speak can do so, and I hope other Front Benchers will do the same. I want to
    start by setting out briefly why we are pursuing this strategy. If Members will
    forgive me, I will do that before I take interventions. I will obviously be happy
    to take interventions a little later.</p><p pid=\"b.1159.3/368\">I am a staunch
    Unionist. I support the devolution of powers to the different parts of the United
    Kingdom. I want the United Kingdom to remain secure and intact. I was delighted
    when the Scottish people voted clearly to stay in the United Kingdom. The whole
    is greater than the sum of our parts. Indeed, I have great affection for all the
    countries of the United Kingdom, so I cheered when Wales and Northern Ireland
    secured their places in Euro 2016 and was dismayed last Sunday when Scotland was
    so narrowly pipped at the post at Twickenham. I will always cheer the home nations
    in competition.</p><p pid=\"b.1159.3/369\">I have, however, listened with concern
    to some in England who have expressed less enthusiasm than me about the future
    of the UK. I am sure I am not alone in having experienced strong views from an
    English perspective about the nature and extent of devolution, and the sense that
    somehow the other parts of the United Kingdom are getting something that the English
    are not. It is clearly not in the interests of the Union for us to see mounting
    resentment in any part of the United Kingdom. That is why I looked carefully at
    the polling evidence that suggests a majority of Scots think the approach we are
    taking is fair.</p><p pid=\"b.1159.3/370\">To all of those in Wales, Scotland
    and Northern Ireland who share my concern for the future of the Union, I say this:
    it cannot be in the interests of any of us to see the English people becoming
    cynical about the Union and even perhaps wishing for its end. That is why I think
    these proposals will help to secure what most reasonable people would think was
    a fair settlement across the United Kingdom.</p>"

  question: The Speaker put forthwith the Question already proposed from the Chair
    (Standing Order No. 83E), That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: <p class="" pid="c.157.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="c.157.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">I
    would like once again to briefly outline the provisions of this Finance Bill.
    These measures demonstrate the Government&#8217;s commitment to support working
    people, support business and protect the public finances by tackling tax avoidance
    and evasion. They mark the next steps on our path to economic security, building
    on the economic foundations laid in the last Parliament and continuing our long-term
    plan for the economic stability and prosperity of this country.</p><p pid="c.157.2/3">Let
    me turn first to the support that the Bill provides for working people. This Government
    are committed to the principle that hard-working people should keep more of the
    money they earn. That is why, following the measures introduced in the last Parliament,
    27.5 million individuals saw their typical income tax bill reduced by &#163;825,
    but we want to go further. This Bill increases the tax-free personal allowance
    to &#163;11,000 in 2016-17 and to &#163;11,200 in 2017-18. We will also increase
    the higher rate threshold, from &#163;42,385 in 2015-16 to &#163;43,000 in 2016-17.
    The Government also believe that individuals working 30 hours a week on the national
    minimum wage should not pay income tax. That is why we are enshrining it in law
    that once the personal allowance has reached &#163;12,500, it will always be at
    least the equivalent of 30 hours a week on the national minimum wage.</p><p pid="c.157.2/4">It
    is a basic human aspiration to pass something on to one&#8217;s children, an aspiration
    the Government are committed to supporting. The Bill will help people to provide
    for their families after they have gone by phasing in a new &#163;175,000 per
    person transferable allowance, when a person&#8217;s home is passed on at death
    to their direct descendants. By the end of the Parliament, the effective inheritance
    tax threshold for married couples and civil partners will therefore be &#163;1
    million.</p>

    whilst affirming its support for helping more people, particularly young people,

    of rogue private landlords and letting agents, declines to give a Second Reading
    to the Housing and Planning Bill because the Bill will not help most people struggling
    to buy their own home, will mean a severe loss of affordable homes for local communities
    across England, will centralise significant powers in the hands of the Secretary
    of State and deprive councils of the capacity to meet the housing needs of their
    communities and local people of a proper say in the planning process, and will
    weaken the obligation of private developers to contribute towards affordable homes
    for local people.</p><p pid="b.735.0/3">After five years of failure on housing

    This is not that Bill.</p><p pid="b.735.0/4">There are some parts of the Bill
    that we welcome, but I have to say that they are few and far between. We welcome
    steps to control the worst private landlords, to help young people get their first
    foot in the housing market, and to speed up compulsory purchase. We aim to make
    those steps much stronger as the Bill goes through Parliament. However, if you
    are a young person or a family earning an ordinary income and trying to get on,
    then this is a bad Bill. If you want to buy your own home, then these so-called
    starter homes are a non-starter for you, and they are unaffordable to most people
    on average incomes. If you are a working family on modest wages in a council or
    housing association home, then you face your rent being hiked as a result of the
    Bill. If you are worried about rising rents and insecurity in your private rented
    home&#8212;one in four families with kids in England now brings them up in private
    rented accommodation&#8212;this Bill does nothing for you.</p>

    it can to ensure that the lives of the next generation are better than those of

    generation have the homes they need. Indeed, it is not just about the next generation.
    The impact of much of the public policy that we debate is on the here and now
    or the next few years ahead. If we look around any city, town or village in Britain,
    it is obvious that housing endures for many decades and, in some cases, for hundreds
    of years. Every home that is built is much more than a pile of bricks and mortar
    or concrete and glass. The homes that we build shape the lives, for better or
    for worse, of generation after generation of people who live in them.</p><p pid="b.721.3/3">As

    start by thanking all Members who have taken part in our deliberations on this
    important Bill. We had a robust debate on Second Reading, and a lively and passionate
    debate continued in Committee. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" name="Kevin Brennan"
    person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10753">the hon. Member for Cardiff West (Kevin
    Brennan)</phrase>, who led for the Labour Opposition, and <phrase class="honfriend"

    me on my toes throughout, and I have to admit that on occasion their fancy footwork
    pushed me uncomfortably close to the ropes. It is only because of the superb support
    of officials in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the unfailing
    vigilance of my hon. Friend the Whip, and my PPS, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Anne Marie Morris" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24912">the Member
    for Newton Abbot (Anne Marie Morris)</phrase>, and the stalwart resolve of hon.
    Friends on the Committee that we were able to resist their forensic fuselage.</p><p
    pid="a.340.0/3">This Bill seeks to do two things&#8212;to modernise the relationship
    between trade unions and their members, and to redress the balance between the
    rights of trade unions and the rights of the general public, whose lives are often
    disrupted by strikes. We have brought it forward as a party that believes in trade
    unions, that is proud to win the support of many trade union members at elections,
    and that wants trade unions to carry on doing the excellent work they do to encourage
    workplace learning and resolve disputes at work.</p><p pid="a.340.0/4">Madam Deputy
    Speaker, I am not sure whether you are as assiduous a reader of the ConservativeHome
    website as I am, but today the leader of the Scottish Conservative party published
    a superb piece about the importance of trade unions and hailed the launch of the
    Conservative Trade Unionists group by the Minister without Portfolio, my right
    hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Robert Halfon" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24784">the
    Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)</phrase>.</p><p pid="a.340.0/5">The measures
    in this Bill are rooted in the manifesto, on the basis of which we won a majority
    of the seats in the House of Commons at the election in May. They are supported
    by members of the public whose interests as parents, as patients and as commuters
    we were elected to defend. The measures have secured clear majorities on Second
    Reading, in Committee and on Report, and I hope they will secure a similarly clear
    majority on Third Reading.</p>

    notes that the Government&#8217;s existing plans to cut tax credits will cost
    more than three million working families an average of &#163;1,300 a year from
    next April; further notes that 4.1 million children now live in absolute poverty,
    an increase of 500,000 since 2009-10; notes that in 2014 the UK&#8217;s current
    account deficit reached the highest level ever recorded, at 5.1 per cent; notes
    that 85 per cent of the money saved from tax and benefit changes in the last Parliament
    came from women; further believes that the Government has failed to deliver the
    more sustainable economy the country needs; notes that, rather than investing
    in building new homes to cut housing benefit costs, housing investment has been
    slashed and housing benefit has risen by over &#163;2 billion a year in real terms;
    notes that the gap between UK productivity per hour worked and the rest of the
    G7 grew to 20 percentage points in 2014, the widest productivity gap since 1991;
    believes that further deep cuts to the budget of the Department for Business,
    Innovation and Skills could damage the Government&#8217;s ability to boost innovation
    and productivity and could restrict opportunities for British businesses and workers
    to succeed in the global economy; calls on the Government to reverse fully and
    fairly its plans to cut tax credits from next April; and further calls for the
    Government to invest in growing a more productive economy with a focus on science,
    technology and green jobs to equip Britain for the future and share more fairly
    the proceeds of growth.</p><p pid="a.694.3/3">We have chosen to devote a section
    of today&#8217;s Opposition day to set the scene for next week&#8217;s autumn
    statement and comprehensive spending review. This will be the last chance many

    he comes to his final conclusions on his spending plans and economic strategy
    for the coming period.</p><p pid="a.694.3/4">The Chancellor is not in the Chamber
    today. Naturally, we are disappointed, but I spoke to him before this debate.
    He is working hard on the comprehensive spending review, so I think we will forgive
    him if he gets his sums right and comes to the right conclusions.</p><p pid="a.694.3/5">The
    Chancellor&#8217;s decisions next week will have serious consequences for every
    constituency in the country. What we all need from the Chancellor is wise judgment
    and fairness. Our country faces serious challenges and risks ahead, which we should
    not underestimate.</p><p pid="a.694.3/6">Let me first deal with one issue that
    overrides all others. It has been heart breaking to watch the tragic events in
    Paris at the weekend unfold into the suffering of families coming to the realisation
    of their loss. I sent a message of condolence and solidarity to our counterpart
    Michel Sapin, the French Finance Minister, at the weekend. It is true that the
    first duty of a state is to protect its citizens, so may I therefore assure the
    Chancellor that he and the Prime Minister have our full support for the enhanced
    expenditure to strengthen our security services that they have announced this
    week?</p><p pid="a.694.3/7">May I also say that we share the view of the Metropolitan
    police commissioner and other police chiefs that the first line of gaining intelligence
    on potential hazards and threats to our safety, preventing terrorist attacks and
    responding to them is often the police officer in the community and on the street?
    There has been a great deal of speculation in the media about the scale of potential
    cuts to the policing service, prompting severe warnings from police authorities&#8212;on
    a cross-party basis&#8212;about the consequences for the safety of the public
    if this scale of cuts goes ahead. May I therefore assure the Chancellor that we
    would also support an urgent review of the policing budget proposals to avert
    this risk to the service, and that we would support any enhanced expenditure plans
    being placed outside the parameters of the fiscal constraints of the charter for
    budget responsibility?</p>

  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="c.268.0/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,
    That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p class="" pid="c.268.0/2" pwmotiontext="yes">We
    have heard considerable debate and lively discussion as the Immigration Bill has
    been discussed today and at the various other stages. A range of views and concerns
    have been expressed and considered amendments have been voted on. As we come to
    Third Reading, it is important that we remember why the Bill is so necessary,
    so I want to reflect on what we believe the Bill will do.</p><p pid="c.268.0/3">As
    I said on Second Reading, we must continue to build an immigration system that
    is fair to British citizens and people who come here legitimately to play by the
    rules and contribute to our society. That means ensuring that immigration is balanced
    and sustainable and that net migration can be managed.</p><p pid="c.268.0/4">I
    am sure that the whole House will agree that, without immigration, this country
    would not be the thriving multiracial, multifaith democracy that it is today.
    Immigration has brought tremendous benefits&#8212;to our economy, our culture
    and our society&#8212;but, as I have said before, when net migration is too high,
    and the pace of change too fast, it puts pressure on schools, hospitals, accommodation,
    transport and social services, and it can drive down wages for people on low incomes.
    That is not fair on the British public and it is not fair on those who come here
    legitimately and play by the rules. So since 2010 the Government have reformed
    the chaotic and uncontrolled immigration system that we inherited, and instead
    we are building one that works in the national interest.</p><p pid="c.268.0/5">This
    Bill will ensure that we can go further in bringing clarity, fairness and integrity
    to the immigration system. I would like to thank right hon. and hon. Members on
    both sides of the House for their constructive contributions in shaping this Bill
    during its parliamentary stages, and all those who have been involved in working
    on it: the members of the Committee, the House authorities, the organisations
    who gave evidence to the Bill Committee, and those who responded to all the consultations
    and provided briefing on the Bill. I thank and commend my right hon. Friend the
    Minister for Immigration for the thoughtful way in which he has steered the Bill
    through the House. It has been important and substantial work. I want to highlight
    briefly some of the measures in the Bill.</p><p pid="c.268.0/6">The exploitation
    of vulnerable people by unscrupulous employers is an issue that has been raised
    by victims&#8217; campaign groups, charitable organisations and Members in this
    House many times before. We know that labour market exploitation can be committed
    by organised criminal gangs, and it is clear that workers&#8217; rights need to
    be enforced more effectively, and that the current regulatory framework needs
    improvement. This Bill will create a new statutory Director of Labour Market Enforcement
    to oversee and co-ordinate the drive for more effective enforcement across the
    spectrum of non-compliance.</p><p pid="c.268.0/7">The House will appreciate that
    illegal working remains one of the principal pull factors for people coming to
    live in the UK illegally, so we are taking the necessary step of making illegal
    working a criminal offence. This addresses a genuine gap in our ability to use
    proceeds of crime powers to seize and confiscate the profits made by those who
    choose to break our immigration laws. But we should be clear that this measure
    is not intended to&#8212;nor will it&#8212;punish the vulnerable, such as those
    who are trafficked here and forced to work illegally. The safeguards provided
    in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 will continue to protect people in those circumstances.
    Instead, we want to deal with those illegal migrants who choose to work here illegally
    when they should, and could, leave the UK. But we must also target the employers
    who facilitate illegal working. The Bill will allow us to strengthen sanctions
    for employers who knowingly turn a blind eye to the fact that they are employing
    illegal workers.</p><p pid="c.268.0/8">We also know that a great deal of illegal
    working happens in licensed sectors. The Bill will ensure that those working illegally
    or employing illegal workers cannot obtain licences to sell alcohol or run late
    night take-away premises. Similarly, we will be requiring licensing authorities
    to check the immigration status of taxi or private hire vehicle drivers. The message
    is simple&#8212;illegal working is wrong, and it will not be tolerated.</p><p
    pid="c.268.0/9">Too often, illegal migrants ignore the law, remain illegally in
    this country and take advantage of our very generous public services. That cannot
    be allowed to continue, so we will further restrict access to services. We will
    make it easier for landlords to evict illegal migrants while also introducing
    new offences for rogue landlords who repeatedly rent to illegal migrants. We will
    crack down on those driving while in the UK illegally by ensuring that, if they
    hold UK driving licences, their licences can be seized and taken out of circulation.
    We will also strengthen the consequences for those continuing to drive without
    lawful immigration status, including powers to detain their vehicle.</p><p pid="c.268.0/10">We
    will create a duty on banks and building societies periodically to check the immigration
    status of existing current account holders so that accounts held by illegal migrants
    can be closed or frozen following a court order.</p><p pid="c.268.0/11">It is
    right that we address the appeals issue so that we can remove people with no right
    to be in the UK. In 2014 we introduced our deport now, appeal later scheme, which
    has helped us to deport over 230 foreign national offenders. In our manifesto,
    we committed to extending that to all human rights cases, provided it does not
    breach human rights. The Bill allows us to do just that, to ensure that illegal
    migrants who have not been offered leave to remain cannot frustrate the removal
    process.</p><p pid="c.268.0/12">We will also ensure as a result of the Bill that
    when foreign criminals are released on bail we can place a satellite tag on them
    so that we know their whereabouts and can improve public protection.</p><p pid="c.268.0/13">The
    Government are clear that we have a duty to offer support to those who come to
    the UK and seek our protection while their claim is being assessed. But it cannot
    be right for that support to continue once it has been established and confirmed
    by the courts that an individual has no need of our protection and could, and
    should, leave the UK. Such individuals are illegal migrants, and to support them
    further would be unfair on those who do need our protection and our support to
    establish a new life here. The Bill redresses that balance and removes incentives
    to remain here illegally.</p><p pid="c.268.0/14">Two other aspects are important.
    Controlling our borders is vital in protecting national security. It is imperative
    that we know who is seeking to enter the UK and that we are able to stop them
    if they seek to do us harm. The Bill gives Border Force officers more powers to
    intercept vessels at sea, increase penalties for airline and port operators who
    fail to present passengers to immigration control, and automatically apply UN
    or EU travel bans to stop dangerous individuals coming to the UK.</p><p pid="c.268.0/15">Secondly,
    in line with our manifesto, we will ensure that customer-facing public sector
    workers are able to speak English. Where communicating with the British public
    is a vital part of the job, fluent English should be a prerequisite, and through
    this Bill we will legislate to ensure that this becomes a reality.</p><p pid="c.268.0/16">When
    the Government first came to power in 2010, the immigration system that we inherited
    was chaotic and uncontrolled. Over the past five years we have taken great strides
    forward in reforming it. We have tightened immigration routes where abuse was
    rife, shut down more than 920 bogus colleges, capped the number of non-EEA migrant
    workers admitted to the UK, reformed family visas, and protected our public services
    from abuse. These reforms are working, but we must go further. This Bill will
    build on our achievements and ensure that we have an immigration system that is
    firm and effective, fair on the British public and on those who come here legitimately,
    and, most importantly, serves the national interest. I commend this Bill to the
    House.</p>'

  question: Question put, That the amendment be made.
  tidied_motion:
  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="d.487.1/1">I will not give way, because time is very
    short.</p><p pid="d.487.1/2">I believe that today we saw the House at its best.
    A total of 104 Members have spoken. We heard forensic analysis and passionate
    conviction. I think that we can collectively be satisfied that, as a House, we
    have done justice to the gravity of the subject. With so many contributions and
    only a few minutes remaining, I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will forgive
    me if I do not acknowledge them all individually, but I will do my best to try
    to address the principal themes and questions that have arisen during the debate.</p><p
    pid="d.487.1/3">One of the key issues is the need to understand what the military
    plan is and who will deliver it. I have to say that there appears to be some confusion
    about that, so let me try to clarify it. We all agree that airstrikes alone will
    not finish ISIL, but they will deliver immediate benefit. They will reduce ISIL&#8217;s
    external attack planning capability, making Britain safer, and they will, over
    time, degrade ISIL and force a change in its behaviour. However, airstrikes alone
    will not create a vacuum.</p><p pid="d.487.1/4">During the debate, some hon. Members
    have sought to have it both ways, arguing that bombing ISIL in Raqqa will not
    make a difference, and at the same time suggesting that bombing ISIL in Raqqa
    will immediately create a power vacuum. Ultimately, there will need to be a ground
    assault on Raqqa, supported by continued airstrikes. However, as <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Yvette Cooper" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10131">the right hon.
    Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> said,
    that will come not in days or weeks, but in months and perhaps years, and that
    is before it even begins, let alone ends. We have had questions about ground forces&#8212;where
    are the ground forces going to come from? The context of this is a comprehensive
    strategy&#8212;a military track against ISIL and a political track against Assad.
    The time for retaking ISIL&#8217;s heartland in Syria will be when the civil war
    is ended, a transitional Government are in place, and the world can then once
    again support the Syrian Government so that that Syrian army, the Syrian opposition
    forces and the Kurdish forces can turn their guns on ISIL, liberating their own
    country from this evil organisation, supported by the coalition with weapons,
    with training, with technical support, and with air power.</p><p pid="d.487.1/5">Much
    has been made during the course of this debate about the number of opposition
    fighters available to join in that effort. The number of 70,000 is a number produced
    by the Joint Intelligence Committee. It is a number corroborated by the evidence
    of our US allies. But the situation on the ground is complex. There is a spectrum
    of views included in that 70,000-strong force. Yes, it includes a large element
    of secularists who have views that we would recognise as democratic, and yes,
    it also includes Islamists, but there are Islamists in the parliaments of Kuwait
    and Tunisia. We can work with Islamists who accept the democratic process and
    are prepared to take part in it.</p><p pid="d.487.1/6">The second issue that has
    arisen during the course of this debate is a question about the overall strategy.
    The Prime Minister was absolutely clear that military action is just one part
    of a comprehensive strategy. There has to be a political track and there has to
    be a humanitarian track. It is clear that we have to pursue the political track
    in parallel with the military. It is the only way to end the civil war in Syria
    and bring about the defeat of ISIL. Now we have an international Syria support
    group&#8212;the Vienna process. That is a major change in the context here, bringing
    together all the major international players behind a common vision of what is
    needed to end the war. It includes Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia, as well as the
    US, UK, France, Turkey and China. For the first time, all these countries have
    accepted the need for Syrian-led, Syrian-owned political transition based on the
    Geneva principles&#8212;a transition that will leave the institutions of the state
    intact, avoiding the mistakes that were made in Iraq. Of course differences remain
    between the parties, particularly about Assad how will transition out, but they
    have agreed together a time frame for political negotiations, including transitional
    government within six months and a new constitution and free and fair elections
    within 18 months.</p><p pid="d.487.1/7">I know that there are those who question
    the commitment of the United States or the engagement of Russia in this process,
    so I want, if I may, to quote from a letter that I have received this morning
    from the United States Secretary of State, John Kerry. He says:</p><p pid="d.487.1/8">&#8220;The
    United States has long believed that while military action can reinforce diplomacy
    there can be no military solution to the civil war in Syria. We have to pursue
    a political track. And at the same time there can be no political deal with Daesh.
    They have to be degraded by military force.&#8221;</p><p pid="d.487.1/9">He goes
    on to say that</p><p pid="d.487.1/10">&#8220;the Vienna process presents the best
    opportunity in four years for an agreement that can establish a ceasefire and
    create a political process leading to a new constitution and democratic elections.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="d.487.1/11">Importantly, he concludes by telling me this:</p><p pid="d.487.1/12">&#8220;Senior
    Russian officials have helped lead the effort to find a common way forward and
    have expressed firm commitment to the Geneva principles. Russian leaders have
    indicated both publicly and privately on numerous occasions that they are open
    to a political transition, including a new constitution and elections.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="d.487.1/13">The third issue that came up several times during the course
    of today is the question of whether airstrikes will make a difference. The right
    hon. Member for Leeds Central and several other Members made the point that they
    were effective in halting the precipitate advance of Daesh in Iraq last year and
    are now contributing to the erosion of Daesh positions in Iran. The UK already
    provides a significant element of the high-precision strike available to the coalition,
    and that high-precision strike will be vital to the campaign in Raqqa.</p><p pid="d.487.1/14"><phrase
    class="honfriend" name="Richard Burden" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10076">The
    hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> asked about the
    rules of engagement. Rules of engagement are classified, but I can tell him that
    the UK&#8217;s rules of engagement are among the most restrictive in the world.
    Bringing British discipline, British skills and British precision weapons to bear
    will save lives as we prosecute this campaign. We will minimise civilian casualties.
    There is no military logic and no moral logic to prosecuting ISIL in Iraq but
    not targeting its HQ in Syria.</p><p pid="d.487.1/15">Finally, I want to turn
    to the fourth issue that has arisen during the course of this debate: will Britain&#8217;s
    taking part in airstrikes increase the threat to our security?</p><p pid="d.487.1/16">In
    2014, there were 15 ISIL external attack plans. This year, so far, there have
    been 150. The scale of this problem is rising exponentially. ISIL already poses
    a direct threat to the United Kingdom: 30 British tourists killed on the beaches
    of Tunisia, what could have been a British plane downed over the deserts of Sinai
    and seven different terrorist plots disrupted by the security services in the
    UK in the past 12 months.</p><p pid="d.487.1/17">The judgment of the Joint Intelligence
    Committee and the director general of the Security Service is that the UK is already
    a top tier of ISIL&#8217;s target list. They hate us for who we are, not for what
    we do. We have to be clear&#8212;I think the right hon. Member for Derby South
    was the first to say this&#8212;that the risks of inaction are far greater than
    the risks of action. We have to act now to degrade this threat to our security,
    and we will do it by targeting their heartland and their control centre.</p><p
    pid="d.487.1/18">We are not debating tonight, as some would have us believe, whether
    or not to &#8220;go to war&#8221;. Fifteen months ago, this House voted overwhelmingly
    to begin airstrikes against ISIL in Iraq. The simple question that we are deciding
    tonight is whether to extend those operations to tackle ISIL in their heartland
    in Syria&#8212;targeting the head of the snake. This is not a fight that we have
    chosen. By the atrocities they have committed, by the murderous regime of brutality
    and terror they have inflicted on the people of Iraq and Syria, and by their clear
    intent and capability to strike us in the UK and at British citizens abroad, ISIL
    have made that choice for us. To answer the question asked by my hon. Friend <phrase
    class="honfriend" name="Edward Leigh" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10352">the
    Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase>, yes, ISIL do represent a
    direct and imminent threat to the UK and to British citizens.</p><p pid="d.487.1/19">The
    decision tonight is this: do we take the fight to them, or do we wait for them
    to bring the fight to us? Do we strike them in Syria, or do we wait for them to
    strike us on the streets of London? What kind of country would we be if we refused
    to act in the face of a threat to our security as clear as the one that ISIL poses?
    Indeed, what kind of country would we be if we were unmoved by the murder, the
    rape, the beheadings and the slavery that ISIL imposes on its subjects? And what
    kind of country would we be if we ignored the calls for help from our nearest
    neighbours even as they grieve for their dead? We cannot contract out the responsibility
    for our national security. We cannot rely on others to take actions to protect
    our citizens that we are not willing to take ourselves.</p><p pid="d.487.1/20">The
    threat is clear. Our ability to respond to it is undoubted. The moral imperative
    to act is compelling. The legal case to do so is watertight. We do not propose
    military action lightly and we do not propose it in isolation. We will vigorously
    pursue the Vienna process to ceasefire, transition and a new representative Government
    in Syria. We will lead the international community in planning and delivering
    post-conflict reconstruction. Let us tonight give a clear and simple message to
    our allies, to the enemy and to our brave armed forces, who we are asking to do
    the job for us. Let us show beyond doubt what kind of a country we are by endorsing
    decisively the motion before us this evening.</p><p class="italic" pid="d.487.1/21">The

    pwmotiontext="yes">Since this House gave the Bill its Third Reading in September
    it has been thoroughly and extensively scrutinised by the Lords, and I should
    begin by paying tribute to them for their diligent and considered approach. For
    the most part, their scrutiny has been fruitful, and the Bill returns to the Commons
    improved in a great many ways. However, on one issue the Lords made a decision
    that differs fundamentally from the view of the Government and, indeed, of this
    House. The Lords amendment would lower the voting age for the referendum to 16.
    This topic has been debated and divided on repeatedly since the general election
    in May. This House has twice rejected a lower voting age in the Bill, and did
    so for a third time yesterday, with a healthy majority in the Cities and Local
    Government Devolution Bill. We have had this debate many times since May.</p><p
    pid="a.865.4/3">Other colleagues wish to speak, so I shall be brief. In short,
    the Government are not at all sure that it is right to lower the voting age, and
    even if it were, this is not the right way to do so. The voting age for UK parliamentary
    elections is set at 18, as it is in most other democracies in Europe and around
    the world. The age of majority is a complex issue.</p>

    the disproportionate impact of this Government&#8217;s policies on women; further
    notes that, according to the Library&#8217;s data, measures in the Summer Budget
    and Autumn Statement have hit women three times harder by tax and benefit changes
    than men; notes that proposals for infrastructure investment outlined in the Autumn
    Statement are predominantly focused in sectors that typically employ more men
    than women; notes with concern that the UK gender pay gap stands at 19.2 per cent,
    higher than the EU average, and that the Government&#8217;s introduction of tribunal
    fees means that women have to pay &#163;1,200 in order to bring forward an equal
    pay claim, preventing many from pursuing legitimate claims; notes concerns raised
    by the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Older Women&#8217;s Commission
    regarding the proliferation of low-paid part-time work among women; notes that
    levels of maternity discrimination have almost doubled in recent years; notes
    the alarming rate of closures of services supporting victims of domestic violence,
    particularly services for BME women; and calls on the Government to affirm its
    commitment to ensuring that women and protected groups do not bear the brunt of
    Government measures, to conduct an urgent cumulative assessment of the impact
    of its policies on women since 2010, to take the necessary remedial steps to mitigate
    any disproportionate burden on women and to develop and publish a gender equality
    strategy to improve the position of women over the remainder of this Parliament.</p><p
    pid="b.1057.1/3">At his party&#8217;s annual conference this year, the Prime Minister
    nailed his colours to the mast of gender equality. He said:</p><p pid="b.1057.1/4">&#8220;I&#8217;m
    a dad of two daughters&#8230;you can&#8217;t have true opportunity without real
    equality.&#8221;</p><p pid="b.1057.1/5">That is right. That is why Labour has
    called this debate to put his party&#8217;s record under the microscope, and to
    assess the extent to which his words are matched by the actions of his Government
    and his Chancellor. It is a record that is found wanting.</p><p pid="b.1057.1/6">Whether
    we are talking about fiscal measures such as taxes and benefits; the labour market
    and women&#8217;s employment rights and chances; public spending on services and
    infrastructure; women&#8217;s safety; or women&#8217;s voice and influence, women
    of all ages and backgrounds face an insecure and worrying future as a result of
    Government policy. That is far from the security that the Chancellor promised
    would be at the heart of his spending decisions.</p><p pid="b.1057.1/7">I suppose
    that we should not be surprised. After all, this is the Prime Minister who regards
    equality impact assessments as &#8220;tick-box stuff&#8221; and &#8220;bureaucratic
    nonsense&#8221;. We all know, all too well, what happens when the Government do
    not carry out full and proper equality impact assessments. Just two weeks ago,
    the Chancellor rose to deliver his autumn statement. His track record in power
    has been shameful. Since 2010, more than 80% of tax and benefit savings have been
    taken from the purses of women.</p>

    covers a series of EU proposals on the relocation of migrants within the EU. They
    formed a central part of the EU&#8217;s summer response to the ongoing migration
    crisis and have been the subject of long negotiations within the EU and of previous
    debates in the House.</p><p pid="a.1330.2/4">The current migration crisis has
    been described as the worst refugee crisis since world war two. It has severely
    tested the ability and resolve of the EU and member states to provide a comprehensive
    and sustainable response that is able to support member states under the most
    pressure and ensure protection for those in real need of it. The situation has
    been and remains complex and fast moving. Proposals have been brought forward
    and adopted extremely quickly; at times, Interior Ministers have met almost weekly,
    and as soon as proposals were adopted, they were often superseded by others.</p><p
    pid="a.1330.2/5">Since the crisis began, the Government have been clear about
    our views on relocation: it is the wrong response. It does absolutely nothing
    to address the underlying causes of the crisis and does nothing more than move
    the problem around Europe. Relocation also reduces incentives for member states
    to tackle abuse, process applications and strengthen their borders. It may also
    encourage more migrants to travel illegally to the EU. We must ensure that the
    permanent relocation proposal does not reduce the obligation on all member states
    to have fully functioning border and asylum systems.</p><p pid="a.1330.2/6">The
    Government have consistently stated that the UK would not opt in to measures,
    whether temporary or permanent. I apologise to the House for the fact that we
    have had to override scrutiny on these relocation measures. The European Commission
    brought forward proposals on relocation as a response to an emergency situation.
    The Prime Minister and Home Secretary were required to make the Government&#8217;s
    views on such measures clear in hastily arranged EU Council meetings.</p><p pid="a.1330.2/7">The
    debates on relocation continue within the EU. Only a tiny number of people have
    been relocated under the agreed temporary measures and many member states are
    now stepping back from their previous commitments. Concern is growing about the
    merits of the permanent mechanism.</p>'

  question: Question put (Standing Order No. 23).
  tidied_motion:
  full_motion_speech: '<p class="" pid="c.1594.2/1" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p><p
    class="" pid="c.1594.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a
    Bill to amend the Representation of the People Acts to provide for the introduction
    of proportional representation as a method for electing a certain number of Members
    of the House of Commons; to make provision about changing existing constituencies
    and reducing their number; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/3">It
    is said that in 1830, the Duke of Wellington, as Prime Minister, declared himself
    opposed to any reform of Parliament on the basis that the state of the representation
    of the people had been designed by providence and therefore &#8220;cannot be improved&#8221;.
    He was of course deeply wrong, as just two years later the Great Reform Act of
    1832 was passed. However, that attitude&#8212;that the means of representing the
    people at Westminster cannot be improved&#8212;is one that has lived on and remains
    strong to this day. Indeed, many Members of the House can find no reason to question
    a system that has had the infinite wisdom to elect each and every one of us who
    sits in the House today.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/4">I put it to the House that the
    means of electing the House of Commons&#8212;namely, the first-past-the-post electoral
    system&#8212;is no longer fit for purpose. It has led to a narrow and unrepresentative
    politics, increasingly poor decision making, poorly conducted elections and, at
    times, poor government. Moreover, it now threatens the constitutional integrity
    of the United Kingdom and the cohesion of the constituent nations of the UK, by
    failing to produce representation that truly reflects the diversity of political
    views contained therein.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/5">My Bill, which is modestly entitled
    a representation of the people Bill, seeks to correct these failings by introducing
    for the House of Commons the same electoral system used in Scotland and Wales,
    and in Germany&#8212;the additional member system. I believe that that system
    delivers the best of both worlds: a local MP with a constituency link, and a representative
    election that successfully reflects the intentions of the electorate. There would
    still be constituency MPs, but there would also be representative elections. There
    would still be strong one-party Governments if the public wanted them, but not
    if they did not.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/6">I will set out why I believe the change
    to be so desirable. I believe our current voting system is bad for politics in
    the UK. It forces the major parties to devote their resources overwhelmingly to
    just a handful of constituencies that they regard as swing or marginal seats.
    Doing so fails to treat voters equally, regardless of where they live, which creates
    a two-tier system of political engagement. As we all know, in some parts of the
    country the opposition parties put up nothing more than a token effort at election
    time. Most worryingly, it creates false electoral deserts, where whole regions
    of the country are dominated by one party despite its opponents recording substantial
    numbers of votes.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/7">First past the post has been a huge contributing
    factor in how remote people feel from politics. As vote share for the major two
    parties has declined, it is a fact that our general elections have become less
    and less representative. If winning an argument with the British public becomes
    a different task from that of winning the votes required to form a Government,
    something has gone terribly wrong. It should be a source of national concern that
    there have been three general elections in history in which the party with the
    most votes has actually lost the general election. If that were to happen in the
    modern day, we would legitimately face a constitutional crisis.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/8">I
    wish to stress that none of this is a means to dispute the formation of the new
    Conservative Government. No electoral system would have produced a Labour Government
    in 2015, because people simply did not trust Labour sufficiently. However, the
    result of the last election should concern anyone with an interest in democracy,
    or simply a desire for national unity. In the south-east, the Tories got 51% of
    the vote, but took 93% of the seats. In the south-west, they got 47% of the vote,
    but took 94% of the seats. In the north-east, the situation was reversed: Labour
    took 47% of the vote, but won 90% of the MPs. In Scotland, the SNP won an impressive
    50% of the vote, but a thoroughly disproportionate 95% of the seats. The Lib Dems
    actually got 1 million more votes than the SNP, but are treated as though they
    got less. Four million people voted for the UK Independence party to get just
    one MP. That is simply not conducive to a representative Parliament.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/9">As
    much as I wish the whole country would simply elect Labour MPs like me, if they
    do not do so, they should&#8212;as best we can deliver&#8212;get the MPs they
    did vote for. Moreover, the electoral system should not write off large parts
    of the country to one party or another, because that forces those parties to behave
    rationally and devote their scarce resources to areas where they are competitive.
    That then creates a perpetual cycle of disengagement, rather than the challenging
    and robust competition of views on which democracy thrives.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/10">Because
    of the unrepresentative nature of modern elections, the Governments that are formed
    after them are prone to make poor decisions or to govern inequitably. At times,
    the British people have given a clear, decisive mandate for change&#8212;1905,
    1945, 1979 and 1997&#8212;but that has not been their verdict at other times,
    when they have been unwilling or reluctant to hand one party exclusive access
    to Downing Street. If that is the British people&#8217;s verdict, there should
    be coalition or minority Governments. Using the electoral system to create an
    artificial mandate for one-party rule is not conducive to good government. The
    argument that proportional voting unfairly empowers smaller parties does not stand
    up when one considers that exactly the same charge could be levelled at the recent
    functioning of first past the post, be that the coalition Government in the last
    Parliament, the Lib-Lab pact in the 1970s, Sir John Major&#8217;s deal with the
    Democratic Unionist party, or the historical example of the Irish nationalists.
    The status quo does of course produce absurdities. During the last Parliament,
    a coalition Government in Westminster were elected under first past the post,
    and a one-party majority Government were elected in Holyrood under the proportional
    system that I am proposing we introduce via this Bill.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/11">I
    know that some people will say to me that they do not wish to change the voting
    system for fear of seeing more UKIP or other minority parties elected. I share
    their disdain for some of those parties, but I would say to them that if people
    vote for those parties, that is surely what they should get. Parties defeat their
    political opponents by debate and campaigning, not by rigging the rules in their
    favour. Ultimately, the alienation caused by rigging the rules in their favour
    will create the resentment that means those minority parties actually win under
    first past the post, as we saw just over a decade ago when the British National
    party won substantial numbers of council seats in the north-west.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/12">I
    may be this Parliament&#8217;s pre-eminent Jonny, but I am no Jonny-come-lately
    to this cause. In fact, I am prepared to admit to the House that, as a young man,
    I travelled the long journey from Sunderland all the way to Newcastle to hear
    the late Roy Jenkins address a public meeting as part of his Jenkins commission.
    However, I believe that the issue has now assumed a much greater urgency. That
    has been produced not just by the declining vote share of the two major parties,
    but by the consequences of further constitutional change in Scotland, be it in
    the form of independence, as the SNP would like, or the much greater devolution
    that the Unionist parties favour. Such developments have profound implications
    for the rest of the Union.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/13">I do not believe that the cohesion
    of England can be maintained by retaining the first-past-the-post electoral system.
    In all honesty, Labour Members ignored the consequences of devolution for England
    for far too long, simply because we did not want to admit that, under first past
    the post, Labour has historically rarely won a majority in England alone. A fairer
    and more competitive system would be better for everyone, because it would render
    such narrow calculations redundant and create a one nation political system for
    a country that sorely needs it.</p><p pid="c.1594.2/14">I am extremely grateful
    for the cross-party support I have achieved for the Bill, which includes support
    from hon. Members from political parties, such as the Greens and the Lib Dems,
    that have positions in favour of a different type of electoral reform, such as
    the single transferable vote. However, we are as one on the need for change. If
    there is one thing that my time as a Member of this House has genuinely taught
    me, it is that the stereotypes of different political parties and the people who
    represent them in this place are unhelpful and unfair. The basis exists for us
    all to work together in the national interest and it would be better if we were
    part of a political system that placed on us an obligation to do so. Therefore,
    I make a plea today for not just a proportional voting system, but a patriotic
    voting system, in which all parts of the country and all shades of opinion are
    treated equally and fairly, and the functioning of which brings the whole country
    together. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>'

    a happy new year, Mr Speaker. I wish the same to Ministers, Members on both sides

    who has just joined us. I am disappointed that it will not be the Secretary of
    State who responds to the Opposition day debate in the name of my right hon. Friend
    the Leader of the Opposition. This is the second time that the Secretary of State
    has failed to address the House when questions have been asked of his Department.
    I am not sure what his excuse is today, but it is a shame that he is shirking
    his duty to speak to the House today.</p><p pid="b.290.1/4">Perhaps we ought to
    take a lesson out of the playbook of the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Department
    and think about sanctioning the Secretary of State if he continues to shirk work
    in this way. Some 600,000 people in the UK were sanctioned by him last year, some
    for failing to turn up to a job interview, some because they were selling poppies,
    some because they were attending their father&#8217;s funeral, and one because
    they had had a heart attack. Someone suggested to me that an appropriate punishment
    for the Secretary of State&#8212;a sanction&#8212;might be to ban him from the
    House of Commons canteens for a month or so, thereby forcing him to go and visit
    a food bank at last.</p><p pid="b.290.1/5">It is extraordinary that the Secretary
    of State cannot be bothered to defend his pet project, universal credit, today.
    Perhaps it is because he thinks he is above answering questions from Members in
    the House of Commons, or perhaps he now agrees that universal credit is indefensible.
    The changes that we are debating today are among the most radical ever undertaken
    to social security; they are changes that should have done what the Secretary
    of State originally intended and made work pay for working people on benefit&#8212;on
    in-work support&#8212;and should have made millions of people in this country
    better off, but after the recent cuts I fear they are set to make millions of
    people worse off.</p>

    is customary on these occasions to thank all those involved in the consideration
    and scrutiny of the Bill in question. On this occasion, I would like to pay particular
    tribute to the Minister for Housing and Planning for having moved so elegantly
    that historic motion for the first time in this House. I also commend the Leader
    of the House of Commons for giving us the opportunity to carry out our consideration
    of the Bill in this way. Throughout our proceedings, the debate has been rich
    and vigorous from beginning to end. Those of us who were here last week for the
    first day of its Report stage will know that there was no let-up in the passion&#8212;or
    indeed the number&#8212;of the contributions, despite the lateness of the hour.</p><p
    pid="b.807.0/3">Before embarking on the traditional congratulations, however,
    I suggest to the whole House that a degree of humility would be in order on the
    part of us all. Housing and planning policy has been debated in this House and
    in the other place for decades, yet for decades this country has not built the
    number of new homes that we need, despite the improvements of recent years, including
    the 50% increase in new housing starts and the fact that planning permissions
    now stand at more than 200,000 a year. The last time we consistently built 200,000
    homes a year was back in 1988.</p>

    rising cost of public transport is adding to the financial pressures facing many
    households; notes that over 2,400 local authority-supported bus routes have been
    cut or downgraded since 2010; regrets that bus fares have risen by 26 per cent
    on average and regulated rail fares have risen by up to 38 per cent since 2010;
    further regrets delays to rail infrastructure projects including the electrification
    of the Great Western Main Line, the North TransPennine route and the Midland Main
    Line; notes with regret the decision by the Scottish Government to award the ScotRail
    franchise to a private operator, rather than exploring alternative options; calls
    on the Government to bring forward a buses bill as announced in the Queen&#8217;s
    Speech to enable the regulation of local bus networks; and further calls on the
    Government to rule out the privatisation of Network Rail and instead extend to
    franchised services the model of rail public ownership that delivered record passenger
    satisfaction scores on the East Coast Main Line.</p><p pid="c.1351.2/3">I start

    class="" pid="d.277.2/2" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that the
    Government&#8217;s planned cuts to housing benefit support for vulnerable people
    in specialist housing, including the elderly and people who are homeless, disabled
    or fleeing domestic violence, risk leading to the widespread closure of this accommodation;
    notes the concern from charities, housing associations, councils and others across
    the country about the severe effect of these cuts; further notes that supported
    housing has already suffered as a result of Government spending cuts and policy
    decisions; notes that the planned changes will apply to all new tenancies from
    April 2016; notes the clear evidence that the Government&#8217;s proposal to mitigate
    these cuts with discretionary housing payments will not work; and calls on the
    Government to urgently exempt supported housing from these housing benefit cuts
    and to consult fully with supported housing providers to safeguard this essential
    accommodation.</p><p pid="d.277.2/3">We have called the debate to give voice to
    hundreds of thousands of elderly and vulnerable people whose homes have been put
    at risk by the Government. It is very encouraging to know that 19 Members from
    both sides of the House wish to express their concern and to make a contribution
    to this debate.</p><p pid="d.277.2/4">We have also called the debate to expose
    the decision to challenge; and to expose it to compassion and to care. We want
    to expose it, too, to common sense. In his November spending review, the Chancellor
    announced that</p><p pid="d.277.2/5">&#8220;housing benefit in the social sector
    will be capped at the relevant local housing allowance.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase

    2015; Vol. 602, c. 1360</phrase>.]</p><p pid="d.277.2/6">With one short, sweeping
    sentence, he put at risk almost all supported and sheltered housing for the frail
    elderly, the homeless, young adults leaving care, those suffering with dementia,
    people with mental illness or learning disabilities, veterans and women fleeing
    domestic violence. According to those who provide that type of housing, he condemns
    nearly half of all such housing schemes to closure. He has already caused the
    cancellation of building work on nearly 2,500 new homes for people in those groups.
    The shadow Work and Pensions Secretary&#8212;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Owen Smith" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24797">the Member for Pontypridd
    (Owen Smith)</phrase>&#8212;and I therefore joined forces to use the motion and
    the debate to draw attention to how the Chancellor&#8217;s crude housing benefit
    cut could hit the lives of hundreds of thousands of people who totally depend
    on such specialist housing, many of whom are the most vulnerable people with nowhere
    else to turn.</p><p pid="d.277.2/7">The National Housing Federation says that
    156,000 homes&#8212;at least that number of people will be affected&#8212;are
    set to close. A survey by <i>Inside Housing </i>found that one in four supported
    housing providers are set to close everything, while 19 out of 20 say that they
    will close some of their supported accommodation.</p><p pid="d.277.2/8">Since
    the spending review, as you might expect, Mr Speaker, I have been asking Ministers
    for evidence regarding the decision. I asked the Minister for Housing and Planning
    how many elderly people will be affected by the Chancellor&#8217;s cut, but he
    told me that the Government do not know. I asked how many women fleeing from domestic
    violence will be affected&#8212;don&#8217;t know; how many people with mental
    health problems&#8212;don&#8217;t know; how many young people leaving care&#8212;don&#8217;t
    know. The Government do not even know how many people in supported housing receive
    the housing benefit that they plan to cut.</p><p pid="d.277.2/9">The Minister
    did tell me, however, that the Government have commissioned an evidence review.
    It started in December 2014 and should have been completed by November 2015, but
    was not. Why not? In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me
    that the delay was due to</p><p pid="d.277.2/10">&#8220;the emerging complexity
    in the design and delivery of the review&#8221;</p><p pid="d.277.2/11">and &#8220;General
    Election Purdah restrictions&#8221;. The Minister therefore did not know what
    he was doing when he commissioned the review, and he must have been alone in the
    House and the country in not knowing that there was a general election in May
    last year. He says that the review will be ready later this year, so he does not
    even know when he will know what, at the moment, he does not know. What a shambles!
    What a serious dereliction of duty from a Government who should be making policy
    on the basis of evidence, especially when that policy affects the lives of so
    many very vulnerable people.</p>

    are in crisis; notes the increasingly high rates of violence, self-harm and drug
    use in prisons, and the resulting pressure on the NHS; further notes that the
    last report by the outgoing Chief Inspector of Prisons warned that outcomes across
    the prison estate were the worst for ten years; believes that no prison staff
    should have to go to work facing a threat to their safety; notes with concern
    the decision of the Scottish Government, announced in its recent draft Scottish
    Budget for 2016-17, to reduce funding for the Scottish Prison Service by almost
    &#163;40 million in cash terms; is appalled by the disturbing allegations of violence
    at Medway Secure Training Centre; regrets the Government&#8217;s inadequate response
    to the Harris Review and to mental health in prisons; is concerned that re-offending
    rates are so high; believes the Government lets down victims of crime by failing
    to enshrine their rights in law; regrets the Government&#8217;s reckless privatisation
    of the probation service and the job losses in community rehabilitation companies;
    and calls on the Government to put all G4S-run prisons, STCs and detention centres
    into special measures, to immediately review the implementation of Transforming
    Rehabilitation and to publish the Memorandum of Understanding on Judicial Cooperation
    with Saudi Arabia.</p><p pid="d.333.1/3">Prison and probation staff have some
    of the toughest jobs in our country. With few exceptions, they work with industry,
    compassion and resolution to protect the public and to help to change lives through
    rehabilitation. All of us in this House owe them our gratitude. Over six years
    in the shadow Justice team, but also as MP for one of Britain&#8217;s most iconic
    prisons, HMP Wormwood Scrubs, and, in the past, as a criminal barrister, I have
    visited many prisons and spoken to both prisoners and staff, and to their representatives
    in the Prisoner Learning Alliance and Napo, to which I also pay tribute.</p><p
    pid="d.333.1/4">The inescapable conclusion is that the prison system in this country&#8212;I
    use the term to include both the adult and youth estates&#8212;is not working,
    contrary to the famous pronouncement of the noble Lord Howard. From the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s
    statements and speeches so far, I think he may agree. The question for today is:
    what are he and his Government going to do about it? It is certainly the view
    of many in his party that prison is not working. We have waited some time for
    a parliamentary debate on the crisis in our prisons. This will be the fourth in
    a week. I hope that is a reflection of the new priority that parliamentarians
    in both Houses are giving to this issue.</p>'

    the publication of the draft Bill last autumn, scrutiny by a Joint Committee of

    privacy safeguards, bolstering protections for lawyers and journalists&#8217;
    sources; it explicitly prevents our agencies from asking foreign intelligence
    agencies to intercept the communications of a person in the UK on their behalf
    unless they have a warrant approved by a Secretary of State and a judicial commissioner;
    it reduces the amount of time within which urgent warrants must be reviewed by
    a judicial commissioner, cutting it from five days to three; and it strengthens
    the powers of the new Investigatory Powers Commissioner. Alongside the introduction
    of the Bill, we published six draft codes of practice in order that they could
    be reviewed by the House.</p>

    Let me make it clear from the outset that, in my view, and I believe the view
    of many others, the behaviour of the Chancellor over the last 11 days calls into
    question his fitness for the office he now holds. I also believe that it certainly
    calls into question his fitness for any leading office in government. What we
    have seen is not the actions of a Chancellor, a senior Government Minister, but
    the grubby, incompetent manipulations of a political chancer.</p><p pid="a.1399.0/5">For
    the record, let us go back to last Friday week. The Chancellor personally forced
    through cuts in personal independence payments. The statement issued by the Government
    that Friday on PIPs was not a consultation and not a suggestion; it was a statement
    of policy. Personal independence payments are the benefits that, for many disabled
    people, make life worth living. They help them get to work. They help them have
    some normality in their lives. Often, they keep people out of residential care.
    The Chancellor was willing to cut away that vital support to some of the poorest
    and most disadvantaged members of our community. Do not tell us that we are all
    in this together.</p>

    Of course, we could leave it as it is for another two centuries&#8212;congested

    lost opportunities, particularly in the midlands and the north. However, the House

    of online VAT evasion by providing stronger powers to make overseas sellers pay
    the VAT that is owed, helping to create a fairer market against UK players . It
    legislates to ensure that profits from the development of UK property are always
    subject to UK tax, reflecting the fact that land is a precious natural and national
    resource, and ensuring that UK developers share a level playing field with overseas
    developers.</p><p pid="a145.1/3">Finally, the Finance Bill introduces a tougher
    anti-offshore tax evasion regime, with new criminal offences and civil penalties
    for those who evade or enable evasion. The Government&#8217;s position is clear.
    We will deliver a low tax regime for businesses, but they must pay their fair
    share of taxes here too. Evading tax is unacceptable and we will continue to bear
    down on it. The Government have announced legislation for 25 measures to tackle
    avoidance, evasion and aggressive tax planning, which are forecast to raise over
    &#163;16 billion in this Parliament, on top of more than 40 changes made in the
    last Parliament.</p><p pid="a145.1/4">As always, at Budget 2016 the Treasury updated
    its distributional analysis. The headlines are: it remains true that since 2010,
    the distribution of spending on different income groups or quintiles has remained
    essentially unchanged, while the incidence of taxation has shifted towards the
    most affluent fifth; the best-off 20% will pay more tax than all other households
    put together in 2019-20; and UK income inequality is now lower than it was in
    2010.</p><p pid="a145.1/5">Since 2010, the Government&#8217;s long-term economic
    plan has focused on sound public finances. Significant progress has been made,
    with the deficit as a share of GDP forecast to be cut by almost two thirds from
    its peak in the last year of the Labour Government. The Finance Bill ensures that
    the record can continue. It provides certainty for working people by reducing
    income tax and rewarding savers. It backs business and enterprise by cutting corporation
    tax and reforming capital gains tax. It supports the simplification of the tax
    system, and it takes bold steps to tackle tax avoidance and  evasion. The Finance
    Bill demonstrates the Government&#8217;s commitment to a stronger, secure and
    more productive economy, and I commend it to the House.</p><p pid="a145.1/6">Question

    an immediate public inquiry into the revelations in the Panama Papers, HMRC being
    properly resourced to investigate tax avoidance and evasion, greater public sector
    transparency to ensure foreign companies wanting to tender for public sector contracts
    publicly list their beneficial owners, consultation on proposals for foreign companies
    wanting to own UK property to have their beneficial owners listed publicly, working
    with banks to provide further information over beneficial ownership for all companies
    and whom they work for, the swift implementation of full public country-by-country
    reporting with a fair turnover threshold as well as ensuring robust protection
    for whistle blowers in this area, ensuring stricter minimum standards of transparency
    of company and trust ownership for Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories,
    consideration of the development of the Ramsey Principle by courts, implementation
    of an immediate review into the registry of trusts, and the strengthening and
    extension of the General Anti-Avoidance Rule to cover offshore abuses.</p><p pid="c360.1/3">I
    see that the Chancellor is absent again today. Much as I look forward to seeing
    the various members of his Treasury team, is there a specific reason why he is
    not here for this important debate? I am happy to give way. [Interruption.] Is
    it critical? In respect of his attendance at the International Monetary Fund,
    he might look at yesterday&#8217;s IMF report that downgraded the growth expectations
    for our economy and think again about the policies he is pursuing, which fail
    to invest in the infrastructure, skills and new technology that our economy needs
    to compete in the world market. Perhaps we will send him a letter and he can say
    hello to the Chamber some time when he happens to be passing through.</p><p pid="c360.1/4">We
    need to move the debate about tax avoidance and evasion on to the issue of the
    fairness and effectiveness of our tax system, and we need to do so as constructively
    as we can. The leak of documents from Panama lawyers Mossack Fonseca has provoked
    an extraordinary public discussion, and an entire hidden world has been brought
    into the light. What it reveals is profoundly unsettling.</p><p pid="c360.1/5">We
    now know that Mossack Fonseca sat at the centre of a vast web of tax evasion and
    tax avoidance. The world&#8217;s super-rich commissioned its services to hide
    their income and wealth from the public gaze. Some of them had plainly criminal
    intentions. Money from the Brink&#8217;s-Mat robbery was allegedly laundered through
    a shell company set up by Mossack Fonseca, while the Mexican drug baron Rafael
    Caro Quintero held his property through a shell company established by Mossack
    Fonseca.</p>'

    rise to speak to the amendment in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, myself
    and several colleagues.</p><p pid="b732.4/4">Last week was the first time I had
    actually visited the other place to listen to Her Majesty read the Queen&#8217;s
    Speech. Usually, I avoid the crush and stay here to have a chat with my hon. Friend
    <phrase class="honfriend" name="Dennis Skinner" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10544">the
    Member for Bolsover (Mr Skinner)</phrase>. I have to say that my admiration for
    the Queen was immensely increased by her ability to keep a straight face while
    reading the fictional drivel that is called the Queen&#8217;s Speech.</p><p pid="b732.4/5">The
    Queen&#8217;s Speech before us demonstrates conclusively the massive distance
    between the Chancellor and the real world. It opened with an extraordinary piece
    of doublespeak. The Government apparently think we live in a &#8220;strengthening
    economy&#8221;. They are seemingly not paying attention to their own statistics
    and their own forecasts. After precipitating the slowest recovery in modern British
    history, the Chancellor is now presiding over a recovery built on sand. Business
    investment has slumped again&#8212;by 0.5% in the first quarter, according to
    this morning&#8217;s figures&#8212;and the Office for Budget  Responsibility&#8217;s
    most recent forecasts are for downward revisions in business investment across
    the life of this Parliament. Consumer debt is rising at record rates, and is forecast
    to remain at unprecedented levels. The current account deficit has reached record
    highs. We are borrowing more than ever before from the rest of the world as a
    result. We are not, as the Queen&#8217;s Speech claimed &#8220;living within our
    means&#8221;&#8212;far from it, on the Government&#8217;s own figures.</p><p pid="b732.4/6">Productivity
    has slumped under this Government. The gap between what the average hour worked
    in Britain produces and what the average hour worked in the US, France or Germany
    produces is bigger than it has been for a generation. Every hour worked in Germany
    produces one third more, on average, than it does here. Low productivity is the
    sign of a weakened, damaged economy. It means lower wages and more insecurity.
    The slump that has occurred in productivity has been far worse in this country
    under this Chancellor than in any comparable G7 economy. It is what has caused
    the Office for Budget Responsibility to revise its future forecasts downwards.</p>

  question: Question put, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="a1145.0/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read
    the Third time.</p><p pid="a1145.0/2">The first duty of Government is the protection
    of their citizens, and the first duty of Parliament is to hold the Government
    to account for the way they protect those citizens. This landmark Bill will ensure
    that our police and security and intelligence agencies have the powers they need
    to keep us safe in an uncertain world. It provides far greater transparency, overhauls
    safeguards and adds protections for privacy. It also introduces a new and world-leading
    oversight regime. It is a vital Bill&#8212;on that, we are agreed across the House.</p><p
    pid="a1145.0/3">It is only right to afford such an important Bill proper scrutiny.
    Three independent reviews informed the Bill&#8217;s drafting: the independent
    reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC: an expert panel convened
    by the Royal United Services Institute; and the Intelligence and Security Committee
    of Parliament. It was then scrutinised by not one, but three parliamentary Committees.
    We have now had a further report from the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which
    said:</p><p class="indent" pid="a1145.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We welcome
    the introduction of a Bill as representing a significant step forward in human
    rights terms towards the objective of providing a clear and transparent legal
    basis for&#8230;investigatory powers&#8221;.</p><p pid="a1145.0/5">The reports
    produced on the Bill, when piled up, reach nearly 1 foot high of paper. It has
    proceeded through the House of Commons on the normal timetable and with the usual
    forensic line-by-line scrutiny applied by the House. I thank the right hon. and
    hon. Members who sat on the Public Bill Committee; those who sat on the Joint
    Committee that gave the Bill pre-legislative scrutiny with Members from another
    place; the Joint Committee on Human Rights and the Science and  Technology Committee
    for their reports; the right hon. and hon. Members of the Intelligence and Security
    Committee, who scrutinised the more sensitive aspects of the Bill; and all those
    right hon. and hon. Members who contributed on Report. The scrutiny that they
    have given the Bill may well be unprecedented.</p><p pid="a1145.0/6">I extend
    particular thanks to the Security Minister, the Solicitor General and <phrase
    class="honfriend" name="Keir Starmer" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25353">the
    hon. and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer)</phrase> for
    the detailed way in which they have worked on the Bill. I also thank the hard-working
    team in the Home Office who have supported the Bill, and all those who supported
    the Committees.</p><p pid="a1145.0/7">It is because the Bill is so important that
    it has received unprecedented scrutiny. It provides a clear and comprehensible
    legal basis for the powers used by our law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
    It introduces the most fundamental reform in investigatory powers since the avowal
    of those agencies with the introduction of judicial authorisation of the most
    sensitive powers. It puts the Wilson doctrine protections on to the statute book
    for the first time; creates one of the most senior and powerful judicial oversight
    posts in the country with the creation of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner;
    and brings the powers of our police and security and intelligence agencies up
    to date, making them fit for a digital age.</p><p pid="a1145.0/8">I have always
    said that I am willing to listen to constructive contributions from those on both
    sides of the House to get the Bill right, which is why the Government returned
    with amendments that I am grateful the House passed on Report. We have strengthened
    safeguards for journalists, for MPs and for the use of medical records, and added
    protections called for by communications service providers. Reflecting the cross-party
    support for the Bill, I am pleased that we have been able to agree the Opposition
    amendment to put beyond doubt the protections for trade union activity. We have
    welcomed amendments from the ISC to add clarity and strengthen safeguards.</p><p
    pid="a1145.0/9">Perhaps the most important change to the Bill is the new privacy
    clause, which places the protection of privacy at the heart of the Bill. The manuscript
    amendment that we tabled and passed yesterday will ensure not only that privacy
    is at the heart of the Bill, but that privacy must also be central to the decision
    to authorise the use of the most sensitive powers.</p><p pid="a1145.0/10">It is
    because we continue to listen that we have committed to make further changes when
    the Bill enters the Lords. Responding to another suggestion from the official
    Opposition, we will introduce a threshold for access to internet connection records,
    to put beyond doubt that those vital powers cannot be used to investigate minor
    crimes. We will introduce an amendment to respond to the Opposition proposal on
    the important appointment of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner. We have also
    committed to implement a number of further reforms proposed by the ISC.</p><p
    pid="a1145.0/11">I look forward to the continued careful scrutiny the Bill will
    receive in the other place, but the key message their lordships should take from
    the last two days of debate is that this House supports the Bill. We have before
    us a world-leading piece of legislation, which has been subject to unparalleled
    scrutiny, and which now, I hope, commands cross-party support. Being in government
    means taking the difficult decisions about the most  fundamental questions that
    democratic societies face. It means striking the right balance between the need
    for privacy and the right to live in safety and security.</p><p pid="a1145.0/12">Being
    a responsible Opposition means scrutinising those decisions thoroughly, but fairly.
    I commend the Opposition for the constructive approach they have taken to these
    most important issues. I commend all those who have contributed to the scrutiny
    that we have seen today and throughout the passage of the Bill. I commend this
    vital Bill to the House.</p>'

    the Government are failing disabled people in Britain&#8212;failing to support

    doing so deliberately, with calculation, care and even premeditation. It was entirely
    premeditated to go into the election boasting about cutting a further &#163;12
    billion from social security but forgetting to mention it would come from disabled
    people and those on low wages in need of tax credits and universal credit. I would
    like to say that we do not know why the Government are doing this, but we do know,
    because the Secretary of State&#8217;s predecessor told us in his tearful goodbye:</p><p
    class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1258.0/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;we see benefits

    one nation credentials&#8212;indicted by their own words.</p><p pid=\"a1258.0/6\"\
    >I welcome the successor Secretary of State to the Dispatch Box, because all too
    often the last one failed to turn up in the House to accept scrutiny or difficult
    questions on issues such as this one, the Women Against State Pension Inequality
    Campaign or the bedroom tax. I welcome the decision he took on his first day in
    the job to stop the plans to take personal independence payments away from people
    unable to dress themselves or use the toilet unaided, and I also welcome the fact
    that in the same speech he said that there would be &#8220;no more welfare cuts&#8221;,
    but I deplore the fact that he must have known, even as made that statement, that
    the deepest cuts had already been made. The cuts from disability living allowance
    to personal independence payments, the cuts to employment support allowance, the
    cuts to the Work programme, the cuts to universal credit: all those sharp incisions
    had already been made. The effects were yet to be felt, but now, a few months
    down the line, the pain is evident, the harm is clear and these things can be
    measured in the widening gap in employment between disabled people and the wider
    population.</p>"

  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b245.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. We
    must create wealth in this country to be a successful economy. We need to have
    an entrepreneurial and dynamic economy. He made this point earlier in the context
    of corporation tax, but similar arguments can be made in the context of CGT as
    well.</p><p pid="b245.1/2">On the criticism that entrepreneurs&#8217; relief is
    badly targeted, I argue that, of course, as with all tax reliefs, it is entirely
    appropriate that the Government keep it under review to ensure that it is well
    targeted and not open to abuse, but we believe that it is right to incentivise
    individuals to set up and expand their businesses. Entrepreneurs&#8217; relief
    plays an important part in our pro-growth agenda. It is a highly popular and widely
    used relief, which supports about 40,000 entrepreneurs a year, according to our
    latest data. We do not believe that this support should be withdrawn. The latest
    published cost of entrepreneurs&#8217; relief is &#163;3 billion, but that is
    a static figure; the true cost will be different, due to potential changes in
    the disposals and behavioural change. That behavioural change is very important.
    On when the data for 2014-15 will be released, these statistics are published
    annually, and the new release is due in October 2016.</p><p pid="b245.1/3">On
    rates going up and down, let me point out that the 28% higher rate of CGT was
    introduced in 2010, by the coalition Government, and this is the first change
    since then. The Government have published the &#8220;Business tax road map&#8221;,
    setting out plans for business taxes over the entire Parliament and providing
    some certainty and stability to businesses.</p><p pid="b245.1/4">On the argument
    that employee shareholder status should be withdrawn, we believe that ESS provides
    vital flexibility for early-stage firms and that it is right that employee shareholders
    receive tax benefits on shares awarded in exchange for relinquishing certain employment
    rights. The purpose of the lifetime limit is to ensure that  small firms can offer
    attractive tax benefits to employees, while ensuring that the benefits are proportionate
    and fair.</p><p pid="b245.1/5">I hope that, with those remarks, I can seek to
    dissuade the Labour party from voting against the reductions in CGT and the SNP
    from pressing its amendment to a vote, but if I have been unsuccessful in persuading

    policy that left companies and investors confused, with feed-in tariffs for solar
    changed retrospectively; an effective moratorium on onshore wind power, despite
    its being the cheapest form of renewable energy; the subsidy for offshore wind
    cut; and the Government failing to indicate what would happen to the levy control

    pid=\"c559.0/3\">The Home Secretary has just made a statement about the attack
    in Nice, and I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences
    to the families and friends of all those killed and injured in last Thursday&#8217;s
    utterly horrifying attack in Nice&#8212;innocent victims brutally murdered by
    terrorists who resent the freedoms that we treasure and want nothing more than
    to destroy our way of life.</p><p pid=\"c559.0/4\">This latest attack in France,
    compounding the tragedies of the Paris attacks in January and November last year,
    is another grave reminder of the growing threats that Britain and all our allies
    face from terrorism. On Friday I spoke to President Hollande and assured him that
    we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the French people, as we have done so
    often in the past. We will never be cowed by terror. Though the battle against
    terrorism may be long, these terrorists will be defeated, and the values of libert&#233;,
    &#233;galit&#233; and fraternit&#233; will prevail.</p><p pid=\"c559.0/5\">I should
    also note the serious events over the weekend in Turkey. We have firmly condemned
    the attempted coup by certain members of the Turkish military, which began on
    Friday evening. Britain stands firmly in support of Turkey&#8217;s democratically
    elected Government and institutions. We call for the full observance of Turkey&#8217;s
    constitutional order and stress the importance of the rule of law prevailing in
    the wake of this failed coup. Everything must be done to avoid further violence,
    to protect lives and to restore calm. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has
    worked around the clock to provide help and advice to the many thousands of British
    nationals on holiday or working in Turkey at this time. My right hon. Friend the
    Foreign Secretary has spoken to the Turkish Foreign Minister, and I expect to
    speak to President Erdogan shortly.</p><p pid=\"c559.0/6\">Before I turn to our
    nuclear deterrent, I am sure the House will welcome the news that Japan&#8217;s
    SoftBank Group intends to acquire UK tech firm ARM Holdings. I have spoken to
    SoftBank directly. It has confirmed its commitment to keep the company in Cambridge
    and to invest further to double the number of UK jobs over five years. This &#163;24
    billion investment would be the   largest ever Asian investment in the UK. It
    is a clear demonstration that Britain is open for business&#8212;as attractive
    to international investment as ever.</p><p pid=\"c559.0/7\">There is no greater
    responsibility as Prime Minister than ensuring the safety and security of our
    people. That is why I have made it my first duty in this House to move today&#8217;s
    motion so that we can get on with the job of renewing an essential part of our
    national security for generations to come.</p><p pid=\"c559.0/8\">For almost half
    a century, every hour of every day, our Royal Navy nuclear submarines have been
    patrolling the oceans, unseen and undetected, fully armed and fully ready&#8212;our
    ultimate insurance against nuclear attack. Our submariners endure months away
    from their families, often without any contact with their loved ones, training
    relentlessly for a duty they hope never to carry out. I hope that, whatever our
    views on the deterrent, we can today agree on one thing: that our country owes
    an enormous debt of gratitude to all our submariners and their families for the
    sacrifices they make in keeping us safe. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221;]</p><p
    pid=\"c559.0/9\">As a former Home Secretary, I am familiar with the threats facing
    our country. In my last post, I was responsible for counter-terrorism for over
    six years. I received daily operational intelligence briefings about the threats
    to our national security, I chaired a weekly security meeting with representatives
    of all the country&#8217;s security and intelligence agencies, military and police,
    and I received personal briefings from the director-general of MI5. Over those
    six years as Home Secretary I focused on the decisions needed to keep our people
    safe, and that remains my first priority as Prime Minister.</p><p pid=\"c559.0/10\"\
    >The threats that we face are serious, and it is vital for our national interest
    that we have the full spectrum of our defences at full strength to meet them.
    That is why, under my leadership, this Government will continue to meet our NATO
    obligation to spend 2% of our GDP on defence. We will maintain the most significant
    security and military capability in Europe, and we will continue to invest in
    all the capabilities set out in the strategic defence and security review last
    year. We will meet the growing terrorist threat coming from Daesh in Syria and
    Iraq, from Boko Haram in Nigeria, from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, from
    al-Shabaab in east Africa, and from other terrorist groups planning attacks in
    Pakistan and Afghanistan. We will continue to invest in new capabilities to counter
    threats that do not recognise national borders, including by remaining a world
    leader in cyber-security.</p>"

    pid="b834.1/3">I am introducing this Bill today because our electoral system is
    broken and we urgently need to address some of the reasons why. As a country,
    we pride ourselves on our strong commitment to democracy, yet the vast majority
    of votes cast up and down the land simply do not count. Power is held by a small
    minority, and the voting system upholds that status quo. We may be on the path
    to leaving the EU, but all those who were promised they would be given back &#8220;control&#8221;
    simply will not have it without meaningful electoral reform.</p><p pid="b834.1/4">The
    current unrepresentative voting system is doing long-term pervasive damage, which
    manifests itself in phenomena such as a widespread lack of trust and faith in
    public servants, and the growth of what some have coined, with Orwellian overtones,
    &#8220;post-truth politics&#8221;. Far too many of our constituents are disillusioned,
    disaffected and disengaged, and continuing to deny them a voice in the decisions
    that affect us all only perpetuates the problems. Yet, that is exactly what happens
    under our first-past-the-post voting system. It is a system where votes are not
    all equal, because unless someone lives in one of the small number of heavily
    targeted marginal seats, their vote simply does not count. The Electoral Reform
    Society has described the 2015 general election as</p><p class="indent" pid="b834.1/5"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the most disproportionate in electoral history&#8221;,</p><p
    pid="b834.1/6">with this Government elected on just 24% of the eligible vote.</p><p
    pid="b834.1/7">First past the post has a long record of failing to deliver Governments
    who command genuine majority support. In 1997, Labour gained 43.2% of the total
    votes cast but won 63% of seats at Westminster. In that same election the combined
    number of votes for the Tories and Liberal Democrats represented 47.5% of the
    total votes, nearly 4% more than Labour, yet between them they got 32.1% of the
    seats available at Westminster. No Prime Minister since 1931 has won a majority
    of the vote to match his or her majority in the Commons&#8212;not Blair, not Thatcher,
    not Attlee.</p><p pid="b834.1/8">Moreover, first past the post creates seats so
    safe that some incumbents are so relaxed as to be almost horizontal. This complacency
    in MPs is matched by disillusionment among voters. How does it engage people in
    the political process if large numbers are driven to vote tactically, rather than
    to vote for what they actually want, because, as so many campaign leaflets are
    always reminding us, &#8220;Party X can&#8217;t win in this area&#8221;? Interestingly,
    MPs in safe seats were twice as likely as those with the smallest majorities to
    be found abusing the expenses system.</p><p pid="b834.1/9">In the 1950s, most
    people simply voted Labour or Conservative, but since then the proportion of people
    voting for the two main parties has fallen from 97% to 67%. Parties other than
    the big three received 10% of the votes at the 2005 and 2010 elections, but in
    2015 that rose to a staggering 24.9%&#8212;nearly a quarter and the biggest share
    since 1945. In other words, people vote differently now, and we need a voting
    system that is updated to reflect that.</p><p pid="b834.1/10">My Bill would introduce
    a proportional voting system. There are two main PR systems, but my preference
    is for the additional member system, because it retains the constituency link,
    which most MPs value enormously. But I have deliberately not specified which system
    should be introduced, because it is the principle that I am seeking to establish
    at this stage. All voting systems have advantages and drawbacks, but none are
    so mind-bending that the public cannot cope with their complexities, despite what
    many detractors of PR like to claim. They perhaps forget that voters already manage
    with a PR system used for the London Assembly and for the Scottish and Welsh Parliament
    Members, and of course we have the single transferable vote for European elections.
    That same attitude demonstrates the very lack of respect for voters that adherence
    to the disproportionate first-past-the-post system perpetuates. Voters are not
    stupid; they know when they are being spun a line or patronised. It is deeply
    insulting to be denying them a fair vote on the basis that they would not know
    how to use it. As an aside, let me say that the fact voters decisively rejected
    the alternative vote system in 2011 is irrelevant; AV is not PR.</p><p pid="b834.1/11">Under
    PR there is a simple relationship of cause and effect for voters. If they vote
    for a candidate, they increase his or her chances of getting elected. If they
    vote for a party, they increase that party&#8217;s entitlement to seats. By doing
    this, they achieve more representation for their views. First past the post does
    not deliver seats that look like the votes cast, whereas PR does. A winner-takes-all
    system in which the Conservatives claim to have a mandate based on 37% of the
    vote and just 24% of the electorate is not sustainable, nor is one in which the
    Greens quadrupled their share of the vote nationally, to 1.1 million votes in
    2015, and got one seat. The UK Independence party polled 3.8 million votes, and
    although I do not like its policies, it is still not right that it got just one
    seat. The Scottish National party, whose Members I am glad to call my hon. Friends,
    polled 1.4 million and won 56 seats. I know that even they would agree that that
    is a little disproportionate, which is why they are here in such force&#8212;I
    welcome that and am grateful to them. Of course, changing the voting system would
    not necessarily have changed the overall outcome, but that is not the central
    point here. The main reason for introducing PR is that making every vote count
    is a vital part of the process of reconnecting people and politics. I believe
    that encouraging more people to come out to vote because they know their vote
    matters would lead to an increased voter turnout.</p><p pid="b834.1/12">Some people
    say that people are not interested in politics, but everyone is interested in
    the state of their local schools and in whether or not they have a local hospital.
    Those are political matters. Whatever someone&#8217;s take on the recent EU referendum,
    it demonstrated that if people are given a say, they can be very political indeed,
    in the best possible sense of the word&#8212;as  citizens who feel they can be
    genuine agents for change. I would also anticipate that under PR we would return
    a Parliament that better reflects modern Britain. Only 29% of MPs are women and
    although that is more than ever before, it still not right when women make up  just
    over half the country&#8217;s adult population. People  of colour, disabled people,
    carers, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender&#8212;LGBT&#8212;people are
    still under-represented in Parliament. I think that would change under PR, because
    MPs would not be able just to rely on the votes of their tribe. To win the support
    of the majority of voters, they would be forced to reach out across the party
    divides to the wider electorate: to more women, to more black and minority ethnic&#8212;BME&#8212;communities
    and so forth. I hope that would mean traditionally excluded groups standing for
    election, too.</p><p pid="b834.1/13">Above all, proportional representation is
    about fairness, which is why my Bill puts PR hand in hand with giving 16 and 17-year-olds
    the vote. Sixteen-year-olds are considered old enough to enter into marriage and
    civil partnerships, pay income tax and national insurance, obtain welfare benefits
    in their own right, and join the armed forces, a political party or a trade union.
    Surely they should help elect the MPs who make decisions about those very things.
    About 64% of registered voters aged 18 to 24 went to the polls in the EU referendum,
    compared with an estimated 52% in the last general election. In other words, increased
    awareness of voter registration, combined with a vote that actually counts, means
    that young people come out in large numbers to voice their opinions.</p><p pid="b834.1/14">The
    United Kingdom was one of the first countries in the world to lower the voting
    age from 21 to 18, but it is now trailing behind countries such as Brazil, Argentina,
    and Austria&#8212;unless, of course, you live in Scotland, which has blazed a
    trail with a more inclusive and equal political system, through giving 16 and
    17-year-olds the vote in the independence referendum. Those young people need
    a say, not just on the future of the Union, but on all the decisions that affect
    their future. We also need equality between 16 and 17-year-olds in Scotland and
    those in the rest of the UK.</p><p pid="b834.1/15">If democracy is about fairly
    representing the views of the people, our current democratic system is failing.
    In future, especially with the Government&#8217;s planned boundary changes, that
    could get even worse. PR would bring some much-needed fairness, as well as helping
    to tackle some of the reasons why people do not vote&#8212;the idea that their
    vote does not make a difference. Just under a month ago, people opted to take
    back control of our democracy, yet unless we reform the electoral system they
    will still have virtually no control over who runs the country or represents them
    in Parliament. Much has rightly been said about the importance of reversing the
    alienation and neglect felt in many parts of our country, which this EU referendum
    result laid bare. I believe that electoral reform and votes at 16 have a key role
    to play in healing the country and bringing it back together. They are a way of
    demonstrating to people that, yes, every vote they cast is important and, yes,
    their voice does matter and indeed has been heard.</p>'

    decision to cap housing benefit support for vulnerable people in specialist housing.
    The decision will affect elderly citizens, our armed forces veterans, those with
    disabilities, people with learning difficulties and people with mental health
    problems. It will hit homeless people and it will jeopardise the safety of people
    fleeing domestic violence.</p><p pid="b840.1/5">Following pressure from the Opposition

    groups and housing providers. I was pleased that the Government agreed to delay
    the implementation of the cap, but I press Ministers now to go one step further.
    They must reverse their decision to slash housing benefit for a huge range of
    vulnerable people living in supported housing. What kind of country would we be

    be doing. I am willing to give way to the Secretary of State if he is prepared
    to stand at the Dispatch Box, say that he will reverse the decision and make the
    announcement that we are all hoping for. To implement that decision would be a
    damning legacy for the former Prime Minister and a broken promise to  those who
    can least afford it. The decision is not just detrimental to the most vulnerable
    members of society; in purely financial terms, it makes no sense.</p>

    pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a bill to implement the withdrawal
    of the United Kingdom from membership of the European Union; and for connected
    purposes.</p><p pid="c920.1/3">The House knows that the position of the Government
    is very clear. Brexit means Brexit, and we will make a success of it; also, Brexit
    means Brexit, and we need to get on with it. I think it important for us to understand,
    agree with, and endorse the position that the matter of article 50 is a matter
    for the Prime Minister alone. She has the mandate of the masses, given to her&#8212;or
    to the Prime Minister, and the Government&#8212;on <phrase class="date" code="2016-06-23">23
    June</phrase>, and it is right for her to invoke it. I believe that the sooner
    she invokes it the better, so that we have the security, the stability and the
    certainty that we need as we seek to build a post-Brexit Britain.</p><p pid="c920.1/4">I
    am introducing the Bill first to give the House an opportunity to endorse and
    accept the decision of the British people on <phrase class="date" code="2016-06-23">23
    June</phrase>; secondly, to talk about the red lines that the British people clearly
    identify in terms of what Brexit will look like; and thirdly, to talk about the
    vision that we can have for the post-Brexit Britain that we will build.</p><p
    pid="c920.1/5">First, let me deal with the issue of where Members of Parliament
    stood when it came to the referendum. As the House knows, I was very concerned
    about the border between Calais and Dover: I did not want it to move back from
    Calais to Dover. The British people did not share my concerns, and I am here today
    to say that that is their decision, and we must endorse it.</p><p pid="c920.1/6">This
    is an opportunity, in particular, for the Labour party to reject the talk of <phrase
    class="honfriend" name="Owen Smith" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24797">the
    hon. Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith)</phrase>, who says that we should have
    a second referendum to drag the British people back into the European Union. It
    is an opportunity for the Labour party to say, &#8220;We accept and we will submit
    to the will of the British people, and we will help to make Brexit a success.&#8221;
    I also say to members of the Scottish National party, who do not seem to like
    the result of any referendum that is held in these isles, &#8220;Do not be the
    Scottish Neverendum party.&#8221; I ask them first to accept the decision of the
    Scottish people, by an overwhelming majority and with an overwhelming turnout,
    to remain part of the United Kingdom, and secondly to accept the decision of the
    British people as a whole that this country, this nation, this United Kingdom,
    should seek a future outside the European Union. I say to them that it would be
    wrong to think that &#8220;If at first you don&#8217;t succeed, vote, vote again&#8221;
    should be their motto. That would be the wrong approach.</p><p pid="c920.1/7">Let
    me now deal with the red lines. It is clear that the British people are deeply
    concerned about the level of uncontrolled EU immigration. They were told, and
    it was pledged in manifestos, that net migration would be brought down to tens
    of thousands, but last year the figure was 330,000. People in Dover tell me regularly
    that they are very concerned about the downward pressure that that exerts on their
    wages, and their concern has  been underlined and proved right by important research
    conducted by the Resolution Foundation which shows that, on average, the mass
    migration that we have experienced has caused wages to be about &#163;450 lower
    for the hard-working classes of Britain. According to the foundation, if we did
    succeed in bringing migration down to tens of thousands, they would have a pay
    rise. Work by the OECD, published in 2014, emphasises that mass migration does
    not benefit, and has not benefited, the people of Britain or those in the rest
    of the world. It does not have an economic good, and it does not work for the
    British people in their daily lives. That red line is crystal clear: we must end
    uncontrolled EU immigration.</p><p pid="c920.1/8">The second red line&#8212;which
    was confirmed by Lord Ashcroft&#8217;s recently published poll&#8212;is also very
    clear. People do not want billions for Brussels: that has to end. We cannot have
    any kind of Brexit deal that includes the handing over of billions to Brussels.
    Instead, the money should be spent here at home, and invested in Britain. My constituents
    say that we need a renaissance for the towns and regions of Britain, and we need
    to use that money wisely&#8212;which brings me to my final and most important
    point.</p><p pid="c920.1/9">What is the post-Brexit Britain that we are going
    to build? What will this country look like? My constituents say to me, &#8220;It
    always seems to be about investing in HS2, or runways at Heathrow, or &#163;4.7
    billion for Crossrail. It always seems to be about benefiting London, or benefiting
    the jet-set elite. What about us in Dover? Why has the A2 not been dualled? We
    have been waiting for that project for decades.&#8221; Every single region in
    the country will be able to specify an infrastructure project for which it has
    been waiting for a long time, while things always seem to work for the jet-set
    elite and the metropolitan populace in London rather than for other towns and
    regions. We need a rebalancing for the 90% who live in the towns and regions of
    this nation, rather than the other 10%. It is time that Britain worked for everyone.
    It is time that public expenditure worked for everyone as well. London receives
    about &#163;10,000 of public expenditure per head, while the figure for the south-east
    is less than &#163;8,000. That is a difference of some 26%. My constituents say,
    &#8220;The allocation of resources in this country is not fair. When we get this
    money back from Brussels, there will be an opportunity to make it fairer.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="c920.1/10">It comes down to this question: who does Britain work for? Who
    do my constituents, and the constituents of the towns and regions of this nation,
    feel that Britain works for? They feel that it too often works for the Philip
    Greens of this world, for the privileged few rather than the hard-working-class
    kids of Dover and Deal and Doncaster and Darlington, and they think that that
    needs to change. First, big business needs a change of culture. We all know how
    Apple has been gaming the tax system and paying hardly any tax in this country:
    it is a bad Apple. We also know that Amazon has a Luxembourg structure. We should
    look closely at its books, and I hope that HMRC will do so. On Google, we need
    to make sure that the Public Accounts Committee is supported in its searching,
    and make sure that Google pays a fair share of tax in this country. When it comes
    to car rental businesses like Avis, it just shows that we are being taken for
    a ride when, the other  day, it imposed a Brexit tax on Britons but is not paying
    any corporation tax to Britain because it has a Luxembourg structure. It is that
    kind of thing that drives the people of Dover and Deal round the bend and we need
    to call a stop to it. We can do that when we leave the EU very simply, because
    we will not be struck by their anti-discrimination rules that make it so hard
    for us to secure our tax base.</p><p pid="c920.1/11">We need to make sure that
    Britain works for the people as a whole, rather than have the bloated boardroom
    bonuses we have seen too much of in recent years. The ground-breaking research
    of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Chris Philp" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25377">the
    Member for Croydon South (Chris Philp)</phrase> recently showed that pay in the
    boardroom for chief executives is 150 times that of employees of FTSE 100 companies.
    That is not right, and that has doubled in the last 12 years. When a shareholder
    vote rejects that, companies like BP just say, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;re not accountable
    to you; we&#8217;ll do what we like.&#8221; That culture needs to change.</p><p
    pid="c920.1/12">We need to have a country that works for everyone, not just the
    privileged few. It is important that we make sure that we have more investment
    for the regions&#8212;that we have runways in places like Bristol and Birmingham
    and Manchester and that we have railways and roads that work for everyone in the
    regions. It is important that we have bigger investment.</p><p pid="c920.1/13">Finally,
    I simply say that Brexit means Brexit. We are going to make a success of it, but
    it is also an opportunity to change how we run Britain, to change our national
    way of life and who our country works for and make sure it works for literally
    everyone, rather than just the privileged few, which is how people have felt for
    too long. That is the kind of change we can make.</p><p pid="c920.1/14">It was
    the towns and regions of this country that decided to take us out of the EU, and
    they should be supported in leading the charge for the kind of future we can build
    as we head out into the single market of the world.</p>'

    pid="c948.2/3">I am glad to open this debate on the NHS sustainability and transformation
    plans. As the whole House knows, the NHS has a special place in the affections
    of our constituents. No other public service engages with us all when we are at
    our most vulnerable&#8212;in birth, death and illness&#8212;and the public and
    NHS staff are increasingly aware that the NHS is under severe financial pressure,
    a matter I will return to.</p><p pid="c948.2/4">In that context of financial pressure
    and concern about the availability of services, the sustainability and transformation
    plans are arousing concern. They sound anodyne and managerial, and there is undoubtedly
    a case for bringing health and social care stakeholders together to improve planning
    and co-ordination. But the concern is that, in reality, the plans will be used
    to force through cuts and close hospitals, will make it harder for patients to
    access face-to-face consultations with their GPs, and, above all, will open the
    door to more privatisation. It tells the public how little the Secretary of State
    cares about their concerns that he is not in the Chamber to listen or respond
    to this debate. We know that recently he has missed all seven recent meetings
    of the NHS board. The public are entitled to ask how much he cares about their
    very real concerns.</p>

    known Debbie, who was a disability campaigner. Over the years, she provided briefings
    for many Members of the House of Commons and, through Disabled People Against
    Cuts, was involved in many of the various lobbies of Parliament. She passed away
    last week, and I would like to send our condolences to her family and all her
    friends. We all hoped she would survive long enough at least to see this debate.
    I pay tribute to her for the work she did.</p><p pid="a261.2/4">I want to explain
    the genesis of the motion that I and my right hon. and hon. Friends have tabled
    for today&#8217;s debate. As we all know, the autumn statement is a week today.
    Traditionally, we would have held an Opposition day debate and used it to have
    a wide-ranging debate, second-guessing and commenting on what we predicted would
    be contained in the autumn statement.</p><p pid="a261.2/5">This year, we want
    to try something different. We want to break radically with that tradition, because
    next week could be the last chance to head off what is shaping up to be quite
    a harmful disaster for many low earners and many vulnerable people in our society.
    For our debates today, we have taken two significant issues that are contained
    in the Budget plans announced earlier this year by the Chancellor&#8217;s predecessor,
    and which the new Chancellor has the ability and opportunity to intervene upon
    and, we hope, reverse. The first is the plan to cut the work allowance element
    of universal credit and employment and support allowance, and for the later debate
    we have chosen the issue of funding social care.</p><p pid="a261.2/6">We believe
    that the Chancellor, by withdrawing the proposed cuts to ESA and universal credit,
    would dramatically beneficially impact upon the lives of many, many of our fellow
    citizens, who are, yes, low earners, but many of whom, also through their disability,
    are also often the poorest and most vulnerable in our society. We want to see
    today and, yes, over the next week, whether we can assemble across the House a
    coalition of pressure that can decisively influence the Chancellor to think again.</p><p
    pid="a261.2/7">I welcome the Back-Bench debate that has been secured for tomorrow,
    which I believe will contribute to forming that coalition; I certainly believe
    and hope that we can succeed in doing so. So the appeal to hon. Members today
    and in the coming week is to do all we can to prevail upon the Chancellor to halt
    the policy of cuts to universal credit and ESA contained in the Budget introduced
    by the former Chancellor, which are planned to come into effect on <phrase class="date"
    code="2016-04-01">1 April</phrase>.</p><p pid="a261.2/8">Before I come to the
    grounds for making this appeal to the Chancellor, it is important to understand
    the origins of the proposals, and this goes to the heart of the autumn statement
    process. I believe their origins lie in the mistake by the last Chancellor of
    imposing a fiscal framework on his colleagues that was simply impractical, given
    the economic circumstances that we were facing, and certainly what we are about
    to face. If the fiscal framework is wrongly set and, importantly, if it so inflexible
    that it cannot reflect the realities and challenges of the economy, then decisions
    on both tax and spending equally fail to reflect the economic realities and meet
    the new economic priorities. I believe that in this instance, the fiscal framework
    imposed by the former Chancellor was so inflexible, and unworkable in the end,
    that it totally failed to meet the economic targets he set for it. It is also
    vital to understand that the former Chancellor&#8217;s fiscal framework imposed
    on his colleagues&#8217; Departments, unrealistic constraints that are undermining
    their ability to achieve their own policy goals.</p>

    that what is best for our democracy is best for all the people of this country.</p><p
    pid="a499.4/3">The events of the past few months have shown us more than ever
    that politics is constantly changing, and in a changing world we need a democratic
    system that is fit for purpose. Conservative Members, in particular, are fond
    of quoting Churchill in this House. While I have never done so before, that does
    not mean that he did not occasionally say something worth listening to. Churchill
    told us that the democracy we have is not the best, but it is the best we have.
    There is a lot of sense in that. However, in order to have a democratic system
    that is suitable for the 21st century, we need to look at ways in which we can
    preserve the best of what we have while looking to improve engagement wherever
    we can.</p><p pid="a499.4/4">That is why I propose that in agreeing to this Bill,
    the House will endeavour to keep what is best about our current system&#8212;things

    Members representing seven political parties across this House&#8212;[Interruption.]
    I see Labour Members are already in an excitable state; I just said &#8220;Members
    of&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b1527.1/4\">It is a great pleasure to move this motion
    on St Andrew&#8217;s day&#8212;Scotland&#8217;s national day. The leaders of the
    political parties complimented Scotland in their remarks at Prime Minister&#8217;s
    questions. When the SNP parliamentary group discussed what motion should be tabled,
    there were many obvious candidates: Scotland in the world or the meaning of St
    Andrew&#8217;s day&#8212;a broad debate given that this is a St Andrew&#8217;s
    day motion. However, we thought it would be better to focus on issues of signal
    importance to the people. The second debate to be moved by my hon. Friends this
    afternoon will be on the injustice perpetrated on the WASPI women&#8212;the Women
    Against State Pension Inequality Campaign&#8212;to see whether a debate can advance
    their cause. This debate is on the issue that has dominated the past two decades
    of politics, both here and internationally: the war in Iraq.</p><p pid=\"b1527.1/5\"\
    >One hundred and seventy-nine Members are left in the House of Commons who were
    present when the debate on the war in Iraq took place in March 2003. I remember
    the figure exactly, because the same number of British soldiers died in the conflict.
    The deaths of thousands of American soldiers and 200,000 Iraqis, the birth of
    Daesh in the prison camps of Iraq and the conflagration in the middle east are
    all directly sourced to the disastrous decision of March 2003. The intention of
    today&#8217;s debate is not to rerun the Chilcot debate of July&#8212;we have
    had that debate&#8212;but to try to identify from that debate how we can take
    matters forward in terms of parliamentary accountability.</p><p pid=\"b1527.1/6\"\
    >I mentioned a few seconds ago that Members from seven political parties in the
    House put their names to the motion. We do not want to rerun the Chilcot debate,
    because the generally accepted view of both the press and the public was best
    summed up in the headline in The Times the day after Chilcot:</p><p class=\"indent\"\
    \ pid=\"b1527.1/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Britain fought an unnecessary,
    disastrous and potentially illegal war in Iraq because of Tony Blair&#8217;s misguided
    and personal commitment to George W Bush, the Chilcot report concluded yesterday.&#8221;</p><p
    pid=\"b1527.1/8\">That is a reasonable summary of the general tenor of the reaction
    to the Chilcot report. What was unstated and unsaid in the Chilcot report was
    what to do with both the amassing evidence, and what to do in terms of parliamentary
    accountability if, as we believe, this House and the public were grievously misled
    into that disastrous conflict.</p><p pid=\"b1527.1/9\">The hon. Members representing
    seven political parties in this House commissioned a report from Dr Glen Rangwala
    of Trinity College, Cambridge. I put the report in the House of Commons Library
    this morning. All Members would do well to give it a good reading. The report
    considers, in exact terms, the statements made over a period to this House&#8212;not
    just in the March 2003 debate&#8212;and takes into account Chilcot&#8217;s findings
    from the wider canvas of information now available, and contrasts and compares
    the two. It might help the House if I make a few remarks on Dr Rangwala&#8217;s
    general findings.</p><p pid=\"b1527.1/10\">In summary, from late 2001 to March
    2003, Tony Blair repeatedly made three interrelated statements to the House of
    Commons: no decision had been taken to use military force against Iraq; military
    action could be avoided by Iraq&#8217;s disarmament of its nuclear, chemical and
    biological weapons; and that regime change was not the goal of Government policy.
    The report of the Iraq inquiry, published on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"2016-07-06\"\
    >6 July</phrase>, demonstrates conclusively and authoritatively that each of those
    three statements was untrue, and that their falsity were known to Mr Blair. Mr
    Blair backed up his claims about the need for Iraqi disarmament by asserting there
    was conclusive evidence of Iraq&#8217;s possession of weapons of mass destruction
    and that these weapons were a threat to the UK&#8217;s national security. On both
    points, those statements contradicted the intelligence assessments put to Mr Blair.</p>"

  question: Question put (Standing Order No. 31(2)), That the original words stand
    part of the Question.
  tidied_motion: That this House notes with concern the disproportionate impact of
    the Government’s policies on women; further notes that, as a result of proposals
    in the 2016 Autumn Statement, 86 per cent of net savings to the Treasury through
    tax and benefit changes since 2010 will come from women, according to the House
    of Commons Library; notes with concern analysis from the Women’s Budget Group
    which states that by 2020, in every income group, black and minority ethnic women
    will lose the greatest proportion of their individual income and that low income
    black and Asian women will lose around twice as much money as low income white
    men as a result of tax and benefit changes; and calls on the Government to affirm
    its commitment to ensuring that women and protected groups are not disproportionately
    affected by tax and benefits changes, to conduct an urgent assessment of the cumulative
    impact of its policies on women since 2010, to take the necessary remedial steps
    to mitigate any disproportionate burden of tax and benefits changes on women,
    to publish a full equality impact analysis with the 2017 Budget and to develop
    and publish a gender equality strategy to improve the position of women over the
    remainder of this Parliament.

    is a pleasure to be here today to discuss this important topic. The advancement
    of equal rights for women is often associated with certain historical milestones,
    such as the right to vote, the movement to end violence against women and girls,
    and reproductive rights. Although those are obviously hugely important, the key
    facet of the ongoing battle for gender equality is gender economic equality. Many
    women never question their right to open a bank account, own property, or even
    buy wine or beer in a pub, but those rights, now taken for granted, were actually
    hard-won. For much of history, and even up to 40 years ago, women were not allowed
    to handle money, and having a job was seen as a sign of financial desperation.
    It was only in the 19th century that women were allowed to own their own home.
    Until the Married Women&#8217;s Property Act 1882, common law in Britain deprived
    women of the right to keep their own property or even hold their own money. As
    late as the 1970s, working women were refused mortgages in their own right, and
    were only then granted mortgages if they could secure a male guarantor. It is
    only since 1980 that women have been able to apply for credit in their own name,
    and it was not until 1982 that women were allowed to spend their own money in
    pubs with the confidence that they would actually be served.</p><p pid="a823.2/4">Those
    changes involved fearless and outspoken people challenging the status quo, questioning
    out-of-date assumptions, and pushing Governments and society to the realisation
    that economic equality and independence for women must be the norm. Today, Labour
    is pushing for the next step in this battle for economic equality: for the Government
    to ensure that their policies advance, rather than hinder, progress. Unfortunately,
    all the evidence points to the Conservative party turning back the clock   on
    gender economic equality, and nowhere has that been more apparent than in their
    major financial announcements, such as the autumn statement.</p><p pid="a823.2/5">Research
    from the House of Commons Library, commissioned by Labour, has revealed that as
    of the most recent autumn statement, 86% of net savings to the Treasury through
    tax and benefit changes since 2010 will have come from women. That figure is up
    on the one at last year&#8217;s autumn statement, which was 81%, but remains the
    same as the one at the Budget earlier this year. Someone who happens to be a woman
    from a black or minority ethnic background is set to lose out even more under
    this Government. Joint analysis from the Runnymede Trust and the Women&#8217;s
    Budget Group has shown that low- income black and Asian women are paying the highest
    price for this Government&#8217;s failed austerity agenda.</p>'

    unions have a long history of campaigning for workers&#8217; rights, stretching
    back to the 19th century. Trade unions ushered in an era of regulated working
    hours, holiday pay, sick pay, maternity pay, health and safety at work and decent
    wages. I applaud those achievements, fought for by trade unions and made law by
    past Parliaments. I respect what trade unions have achieved in the past 150 years,
    and I understand that the right to strike is inseparable from the struggles that
    led to these victories that have helped to civilise our country. But we must also
    recognise that strikes have a profound effect on the wider public, especially
    where those strikes occur on critical national services. It is time to consider
    again the impact that strikes have on the wider public, and to protect the public
    as well as uphold the right to strike.</p><p pid="b194.1/4">A few weeks ago, I
    received a heart-rending message from a constituent, Jenny Lehane. She said that
    tears were streaming down her face as she wrote about the effect of the recent
    Southern Railway strikes on her family. She wrote that she had to get her six-year-old
    son to walk to a bus stop at 5.30 in the morning when the trains were not running
    so that she could get to work and her son could get to school. She said those
    responsible should</p><p class="indent" pid="b194.1/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;hang
    their heads in shame&#8221;,</p><p pid="b194.1/6">and she attached a photo of
    her son trudging disconsolately down a cold, dark street wrapped in his blanket.</p><p
    pid="b194.1/7">That is the human impact of nearly 40 days of strike action that
    the RMT and ASLEF have taken in the past few months, most recently only yesterday,
    to say nothing of the unofficial strike action and work-to-rule that have been
    taking place on non-strike days. The operator, Southern rail, must shoulder a
    great deal of blame. I am not here to defend it; in fact, I think it should lose
    the franchise. But there is no question that the strike action has made a bad
    service unusable in the last six months.</p><p pid="b194.1/8">In this case, I
    do not believe that the unions have a substantial complaint. No one is losing
    their job. No one is getting a pay cut. Every single train currently scheduled
    to run with two members of staff will continue to be scheduled to run with two
    members of staff. The dispute centres simply on who opens and closes the doors,
    and whether the train can still run if the conductor does not turn up for work.
    The rail regulator says that  there is no safety issue, contrary to the union
    position. In fact, millions of trains have run perfectly safely since 1984, including
    1.5 million trains in the last five years, without a single fatality. All of London
    underground runs with driver-operated doors perfectly safely, as does most of
    continental Europe. The RMT is disputing these issues simply to retain its ability
    to shut down the rail network in the course of future strike action by its conductors.</p><p
    pid="b194.1/9">It is on this flimsy pretext that 400 conductors are preventing
    300,000 people from getting to work or getting home to see their loved ones. Sue
    Gaitskell had to quit her job as a sales manager. My constituent Lee Fenton was
    fired from his job working for a local council. Emma Green had to quit her job
    as a commercial lawyer. Many people are having to consider moving home. It is
    just not acceptable that the rights of these people are not being adequately protected.</p><p
    pid="b194.1/10">I am afraid to say that there are signs that this kind of industrial
    action&#8212;hugely disruptive to the public, but based on a flimsy pretext&#8212;is
    spreading. Merseyrail and Great Northern are apparently next in the union&#8217;s
    sights, and two weeks ago London ground to a halt due to an RMT strike on the
    underground over changes that were in fact introduced some time ago.</p><p pid="b194.1/11">I
    am pleased that the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to his great credit condemned
    the RMT underground strike without reservation, but it is very disappointing that
    the Leader of the Opposition did not follow the Mayor&#8217;s example. Far from
    following the Mayor of London&#8217;s fine example, he said that, instead of siding
    with the public, he would in fact join the picket line. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Shame.&#8221;]
    Indeed.</p><p pid="b194.1/12">The president of the RMT, a man called Sean Hoyle,
    did not even bother to disguise his motives. He was recently filmed speaking to
    a group of trade unionists, saying that the strikes had the objective of &#8220;bringing
    down the Government&#8221;; those are his words, not mine. Mr Hoyle is entitled
    to his political views, but he is not entitled to use the power he has as the
    president of a major trade union to inflict misery on hundreds of thousands of
    people simply in furtherance of his nakedly political objectives.</p><p pid="b194.1/13">We
    now need further legislation to recognise the public&#8217;s right to get to work,
    to see loved ones or to receive medical treatment, as well as respecting the unions&#8217;
    right to strike, which I fully accept. We in Parliament should not stand by and
    allow strike action to cause people to lose their own jobs.</p><p pid="b194.1/14">This
    Bill goes further than previous legislation and proposes that strikes on critical
    national services, such as the railways, tubes, buses and NHS, should be &#8220;proportionate
    and reasonable&#8221; in the view of a High Court judge in order to be lawful.
    The judge would weigh up the complaint of the striking workers against the impact
    on the wider public in deciding what is &#8220;proportionate and reasonable&#8221;,
    and where strikes were allowed, the judge would specify a level of basic service
    that would be available during any strike. The law in Canada, Spain and Italy
    already works in a similar way, guaranteeing a basic level of service.</p><p pid="b194.1/15">A
    poll published in yesterday&#8217;s Evening Standard found that 55% of Londoners
    support these proposals, and public support for them is growing daily. Many other
    Members support these proposals, too. In a similar vein, my hon. Friend <phrase
    class="honfriend" name="Huw Merriman" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25426">the
    Member for Bexhill and Battle  (Huw Merriman)</phrase>, who is in his place, is
    introducing his own ten-minute rule Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2017-02-04">4
    February</phrase> to stipulate that strikes based on the pretext of safety concerns
    cannot proceed unless the relevant regulator agrees that there is a safety issue.</p><p
    pid="b194.1/16">I do not for one moment dispute the right to strike, but the public
    also have a right to get to work and not be forced out of their own jobs by union
    action. A fair balance is needed between the two, and I am afraid to say that
    current legislation does not provide it.</p><p pid="b194.1/17">If there is a Division,
    in order to support this motion today Members do not need to agree with the precise
    details of the Bill. For example, Members may think that there are better methods
    of arbitrating between the rights of the unions and the rights of the public than
    through a High Court judge; some have suggested to me in the last few days that
    Parliament itself might be an alternative. But if the House supports this motion,
    we are sending a simple message that the public have rights as well as trade unions,
    and that it is Parliament&#8217;s duty to protect the public as well.</p><p pid="b194.1/18">This
    Bill is about balance and fairness, and I commend it to the House.</p>'

    Euratom and the EU share a common institutional framework, including the European
    Court of Justice, a role for the Commission and decision making in the Council,
    making them uniquely legally joined. Triggering article 50 therefore also entails
    giving notice to leave Euratom. The nuclear industry is of key strategic importance
    to the UK, and we have been clear that this does not affect our intention to maintain
    close and effective arrangements relating to civil nuclear co-operation, safeguards
    and safety with Europe and the rest of the world.</p><p pid="b1005.402/3">Let
    me move on to the role of Parliament. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister
    set out our plan for the United Kingdom&#8217;s withdrawal in her speech at Lancaster
    House, and she has confirmed that Parliament will have its say on the final deal
    we achieve with the European Union by putting that deal to a vote of both Houses.
    There has already been extensive scrutiny in both Houses, and we will publish
    our White Paper tomorrow, before Committee. The White Paper, however, is entirely
    separate from this Bill, which simply gives the Government the power to trigger
    the process of exit from the EU, in accordance with the instructions that we have
    received from the people of this country.</p><p pid="b1005.402/4">There has also
    been much debate over the past two days about the many opportunities that leaving
    the UK&#8212;[Interruption]&#8212;that leaving EU affords the UK. As my right
    hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said, we will be an outward-facing, bold and
    global country, seeking ambitious trade deals, forging new friendships and consolidating
    existing partnerships, and we will remain a tolerant and open country. The triggering
    of article 50 will start the process of our withdrawal from  the European Union,
    and during that process, the House will have plenty of opportunities to debate
    and play a crucial role in scrutinising the great repeal Bill and related Bills
    to come. My right hon. Friend has set out a detailed plan for building a new partnership
    between an independent United Kingdom and the European Union in the years to come.</p><p

  tidied_motion: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to regulate the termination

    pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to regulate the termination
    of pregnancies by medical practitioners and to repeal certain criminal offences
    relating to such terminations; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="e26.1/3">In
    England and Wales, women have a legal route to an abortion through the Abortion
    Act 1967, introduced by David Steel as a private Member&#8217;s Bill, but 50 years
    on it is right that the House has the chance to address one fundamental issue
    that the Act did not address. Abortion remains a criminal offence in this country,
    even if it is carried out early in the term, for the woman who has the abortion
    and anyone who assists her. Under sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the
    Persons Act 1861 and other legislation, termination of a pregnancy carries the
    maximum sentence of life imprisonment. That is the harshest criminal penalty of
    any country in Europe, underpinned by a Victorian criminal law passed before women
    even had the right to vote, let alone sit in this place.</p><p pid="e26.1/4">The
    Abortion Act 1967 did not change the fundamental fact: it merely set out circumstances
    under which abortion could be legal&#8212;for example, the need for two doctors&#8217;
    signatures that specified conditions have been met, including a time limit now
    set at 24 weeks and, in exceptional circumstances, the conditions for abortions
    post 24 weeks. Unlike in other countries, that means that abortion remains illegal
    except in the limited circumstances in the Act. No other medical procedure is
    governed by legislation that old or that out of step with clinical developments
    and changing attitudes.</p><p pid="e26.1/5">I want the House to reflect on the
    following comments from women who have sought help from online organisations to
    buy abortion tablets&#8212;something that no one would have imagined in 1967,
    let alone 1861&#8212;as, in so doing, they are committing criminal offences under
    the 1861 Act. The first woman says:</p><p class="indent" pid="e26.1/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I
    live in rural England and have no friends and the relatives I have I am not close
    to. I was hoping to have a termination in the comfort of my own home without judgmental
    eyes and without worrying about my husband knowing. I fear what would happen if
    he did. I have 3 children and my 3rd is 11 months old. I considered an abortion
    when he was conceived and had a terrible pregnancy and am still suffering from
    post natal depression. I will try to seek help, anonymously if possible. I&#8217;m
    in great need of help.&#8221;</p><p pid="e26.1/7">Another woman says:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="e26.1/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I have visited my GP last week and he
    referred me to my local NHS service. They can only offer me a medical abortion
    with three visits to the hospital on separate days. On the second visit I am expected
    to stay there all day. I work full time and have two young sons so getting all
    that time off and childcare is going to be very difficult, probably impossible.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="e26.1/9">Dr Rebecca Gomperts, the director of Women on Web, said about English
    women seeking help online:</p><p class="indent" pid="e26.1/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Yes,
    we get them all the time. We had an Islamic girl forbidden from leaving the house
    without a chaperone. How is she going to get to an abortion clinic? She can&#8217;t.
    For her, her only option might be that she could get the medicine sent to her
    by post.&#8221;</p><p pid="e26.1/11">Due to the accessibility of medication now
    available online, women are more than ever before at risk of breaking the law,
    and a few prosecutions have already happened. I wonder if any of us truly believe
    that those women, in such difficult circumstances, really should be seen as criminals.
    Let me be clear that decriminalisation will not mean deregulation. Parliament
    can decide to retain existing safeguards within a decriminalised environment,
    including the existing time limit of 24 weeks. Abortion would remain subject to
    the same complex mass of general, criminal, civil, administrative and other legal
    provisions that govern all medical procedures.</p><p pid="e26.1/12">I ask that
    hon. Members also consider the fact that Poland, a traditionally Catholic country,
    does not criminalise women for having an abortion, and even the United States
    has not criminalised women for having an abortion since the Supreme Court judgment
    in 1973. When the current US President suggested last year that women should be
    punished for having abortions, he was forced to backtrack after the public outcry.</p><p
    pid="e26.1/13">In proposing the Bill, I want to thank the many individuals and
    organisations that have helped me along the way, including the British Pregnancy
    Advisory Service, Abortion Rights and, particularly, Professor Sally Sheldon at
    the University of Kent law school.</p><p pid="e26.1/14">I want to address specifically
    the concerns about decriminalisation. I want to be clear about what this Bill
    will and will not do. First, decriminalisation will not make it easier to access
    abortions post-24 weeks. Under the 1967 Act, abortions beyond 24 weeks are allowed
    only in exceptional circumstances&#8212;if, for example, the mother&#8217;s life
    is at risk. The decriminalisation can apply these exact same conditions, and we
    know from countries that have already decriminalised, such as Canada and parts
    of Australia, that there is no evidence of an increase in late-term abortions.</p><p
    pid="e26.1/15">Secondly, decriminalisation will not lead to a free-for-all with
    unlicensed practitioners providing abortions; as now, there will be strict regulation
    and licensing of health professionals. For example, both of the pills most commonly
    used in medical abortions are prescription only. That means they are covered under
    the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, which make it illegal to supply such drugs
    without a prescription. So with decriminalisation, Parliament would need to have
    an evidence-based debate about what kind of abortion provision up to 24 weeks
    would be in the best interests of women and agree appropriate safeguards.</p><p
    pid="e26.1/16">Finally, decriminalisation will not permit gender-selective or
    non-consensual abortions. Some opponents of decriminalisation argue that the only
    way we can restrict these practices is to apply criminal law to everyone. I hope
    that hon. Members will appreciate that it is well within the capacity of this
    House to find a better way forward that does not criminalise all women and all
    practitioners. Let me be clear that under current law, women cannot obtain an
    abortion on grounds of the gender of the child. With decriminalisation, professional
    bodies that are best placed to take action can continue to prohibit this as a
    ground for abortion. It is worth pointing out that the current law does nothing
    about those who try to coerce women in those circumstances. On the issue of non-consensual
    abortions, such as when  a man assaults a pregnant woman, these would continue
    to be criminalised under other laws such as grievous bodily harm.</p><p pid="e26.1/17">Now
    that all these potential objections are addressed, hon. Members can be left to
    ask themselves the fundamental question that gets to the heart of what my Bill
    is about. It is this: should abortion be an inherently criminal act, punishable
    by up to life imprisonment? In asking themselves this question, I hope hon. Members
    will bear in mind the vulnerable women who are ill-served by our current laws
    and whether their care is now being compromised. There is also evidence that doctors
    are thinking twice about practising in this area of women&#8217;s healthcare because
    of the threat of criminalisation. We do not use these laws for any other medical
    practices, so why do we do it for abortion? This is one of the many reasons why
    a range of expert groups, including the Royal College of Midwives and the British
    Pregnancy Advisory Service, support decriminalisation.</p><p pid="e26.1/18">I
    hope that hon. Members will, like me, conclude that the criminalisation of abortion
    suits nobody. Women are poorly served by laws that state that even early-term
    abortions are inherently criminal, and doctors are poorly served by a criminal
    framework that does not apply to other areas of healthcare. We should create an
    environment in which the stigma of the criminal law is removed and in which women
    can come forward for advice and high-quality, woman-centred healthcare as early
    as possible in a pregnancy. I hope that hon. Members will join me in saying that
    in England and Wales in the 21st century, abortion should no longer be considered
    a criminal offence, and that the 1861 Act is now obsolete and no longer fit for
    purpose in this century.</p><p pid="e26.1/19">In closing, I would like to repeat
    an observation on decriminalisation, which has, as I stated earlier, taken place
    in some Australian states. The quotation is this&#8212;that the decriminalisation
    has resulted in</p><p class="indent" pid="e26.1/20" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a
    profound shift in the relationship between the state and its female citizens.
    It changes both nothing and everything. Nothing, because the number, rate and
    incidence of abortion will not change. And everything, because for the first time
    women will be recognised as the authors of our own lives. With that comes our
    full citizenship.&#8221;</p>'

    Bill&#8212;well, someone has to&#8212;not so much because of what it does but
    because of what it does not do. Let me take as an example the inequity of Scotland&#8217;s
    police and fire and rescue authorities  paying VAT. It is a long-standing problem,
    and this Government could and should have taken the opportunity of this Finance
    Bill to rectify it, but they did not. In the Budget, there was at least a recognition
    of the problems faced by Scotland&#8217;s oil and gas sector, but no specific
    measures were announced&#8212;just another options paper, which was effectively
    announced last year. This Finance Bill should have been the opportunity to make
    concrete proposals for UK content and for oil exploration and decommissioning
    allowances to ensure that the sector continues to thrive, to flourish and to provide
    substantial tax yields for decades, but of course it does not. It does, however,
    put up the duty on Scotch whisky, and increase insurance premium tax again by
    20%, which is way above the rate of inflation. Effectively, the Bill treats the
    Scotch whisky industry and the insurance sector as cash cows for the Treasury.</p><p
    pid="b592.2/4">Having said that, we do welcome some of the measures in the Bill,
    particularly those that are intended to clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion.
    I welcome what the Minister said about restricting the use of past losses, disguised
    remuneration, the initial penalties for tax avoidance enablers, and the removal
    of the permanent non-dom status. However, it is hard to see how this Bill will
    assist in any substantial way to address the long-term UK challenge of improving
    productivity or even helping to make society a little less unequal, which is vital
    to unlocking our growth potential. That is particularly the case when one considers
    that alongside this Finance Bill are a set of welfare proposals that do not support
    inclusive growth but, rather, drive a coach and horses through it. They include
    the cut of &#163;30 a week to employment and support allowance for claimants placed
    in the work-related activity group; a 55% cut in the rate of ESA for disabled
    people under the age of 25; the freezing of the lower disabled child element of
    universal credit; and the changes for full-time students who receive disability
    living allowance or personal independence payments who are now not treated as
    having limited capability for work and are therefore not entitled to universal
    credit until they have been assessed, which means that they face long delays without
    support.</p><p pid="b592.2/5">I do not want to digress too far from the Bill,
    but delivering those cuts when disabled people and those on low to middle incomes
    are already facing a barrage of cuts from this Government is a disgrace. Moreover,
    those cuts not only fly in the face of the Tory party&#8217;s last manifesto commitment
    to help more disabled people into the workplace&#8212;something that is vital&#8212;but
    undermine the essential drive for real inclusive growth, which is vital if we
    are to grow the economy and maximise our potential.</p>

    of this year, Mr Speaker, I have been in the House for 20 years, just as you have.
    Never in all that time have we seen such a threadbare scrap of a document as this
    Queen&#8217;s Speech. But let us be grateful for small mercies: it is a pleasure
    to note what has not been mentioned in this vacuous notelet. Despite their being
    promised in the Conservative manifesto, we have had no plans for legislation to
    end the triple lock, we have heard nothing about legislation to end winter fuel
    payments, and we have heard no legislative plans for the so-called dementia tax.
    There is nothing of the policy to take food from the  mouths of infants and young
    primary school children, and even the flagship grammar schools policy seems to
    have been ditched from the Queen&#8217;s Speech. I would therefore like to thank
    the millions of voters who rejected the Conservatives because they have prevented
    the Tories from implementing the full cuts that they promised. I thank all those
    people who called a halt to the barrage of cuts that the Tories were intending
    to introduce. Regrettably, the Government have instead been reduced to a grubby
    back-room deal in an attempt to cling on to office.</p><p pid="c776.4/4">The result

    85.7% share of the vote at the election is a good example of the improved performance
    and productivity to which all MPs can aspire. There are  not too many Members
    who can say to <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Peter Dowd\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25309\"\

    >the Member for Moray (Douglas Ross)</phrase> gave an excellent maiden speech.
    He spoke of the successful business growth in his constituency and his ambition
    for the area, particularly for its local growth deal. I am sure that colleagues
    in Government will work closely with him on that. I am even surer that the Father
    of the House will very much look forward to sharing a dram of the whisky to which
    my hon. Friend referred.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/4\">I will respond to the detailed
    points raised by Members shortly, but I first want to be clear about the purpose
    of the Bill, which is underpinned by principles that I hope we all share: that
    tax should be competitive and fair, and that it should be paid where it is due.
    In the weeks ahead, we will have the opportunity to scrutinise the detailed provisions
    in Committee. The majority of the Bill has already been subject to significant
    scrutiny following announcements made last year or even earlier. Consultation
    has been widespread. Together with the pre-election Finance Bill, the measures
    have had almost nine hours of debate before today.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/5\">The
    Opposition suggest that our strategy to keep tax competitive in some way undermines
    our absolute commitment to world-class public services and that lower taxes somehow
    mean less investment in hospitals, schools and our emergency services. But the
    Government know that it is only through a strong, growing and dynamic economy
    that we can afford the vital public services our country needs. When we help business
    to do well, to invest and to create jobs, we are building our tax base to secure
    that funding for the long term. Competitive taxes protect revenues. Look at what
    happened when we reduced our level of corporation tax. The private sector created
    3.4 million new jobs with an additional &#163;18 billion in corporation tax. In
    contrast, raising taxes&#8212;as the Opposition threaten&#8212;to what the Institute
    for Fiscal Studies describes as their &#8220;highest ever peacetime level&#8221;,
    would put the brakes on our economy, drive investment elsewhere, reduce employment
    and, ultimately, diminish our ability to raise the funds our public services need.</p><p
    pid=\"a755.0/6\">Let me deal with some of the specific points raised during the
    debate. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Kirsty Blackman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25314\"\
    >The hon. Member for Aberdeen North (Kirsty Blackman)</phrase> once again raised
    the issue of termination payments. These reforms are about providing clarity in
    the legislation and ensuring that there are no loopholes that people can use to
    avoid tax. They will not affect statutory termination payments or payments arising
    as a result of employment tribunals. They will not reduce the &#163;30,000 tax-free
    allowance that exists to protect the less well-off when they are made redundant.
    We have no plans to change the &#163;30,000 allowance. In any case, that would
    require an affirmative statutory instrument under this Bill.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/7\"\
    >The hon. Lady raised with the Financial Secretary the issue of whether a statutory
    instrument on tax relief for museums and galleries had been tabled, and I am happy
    to reassure her that it has, as he thought, been tabled today, so it is before
    the House.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/8\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ruth George\"\
    \ person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25633\">The hon. Member for High Peak (Ruth
    George)</phrase> raised the issue of non-doms. Let me be clear: this Bill abolishes
    permanent non-domiciled status. When people live in the UK permanently, it is
    right that they should pay UK tax. Non-doms already contribute over &#163;9 billion
    a year to the Exchequer, and we expect the Bill to raise a  further &#163;1.6
    billion over the next five years. So this Finance Bill will deliver fairness and
    protect revenue. This is a balanced approach, and one that has been subject to
    extensive consultation.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/9\">During the debate, Opposition Members
    criticised the provisions for offshore trusts. Let be clear again: if funds are
    taken out of trusts, they will become liable for tax. As the Financial Secretary
    set out in the debate last week, our international agreements on the exchange
    of information will provide a critical boost to enforcement.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/10\"\
    >A number of Members, including my hon. Friends the Members for Newark (Robert
    Jenrick) and for Harborough (Neil O'Brien), raised the issue of avoidance and
    evasion. The Bill implements a large number of measures to tackle tax avoidance
    and evasion. It prevents businesses from claiming excessive tax deductions, by
    updating the rules around how companies claim deductions for interest expenses.
    It continues our crackdown on artificial disguised remuneration schemes, and it
    introduces a new penalty for those who enable tax avoidance.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/11\"\
    >It is this Government who are tackling tax avoidance and evasion head-on. It
    is this Government who have announced more than 75 measures to tackle tax evasion
    and avoidance since 2010. We have seen HMRC more than double the annual number
    of prosecutions for avoidance and evasion in that time. That is how we have secured
    almost &#163;160 billion in extra tax revenue. We secured over &#163;8 billion
    in extra tax from the largest and most complex UK businesses in 2016 alone. In

    talked about the difference between the tax rate and the tax take.</p><p pid=\"\

    less well-off, supporting our public services, and ensuring a stable and dynamic
    economy. It will deliver by raising new finances to finance new infrastructure
    and technical education, putting productivity first. It will deliver by raising
    new revenues from those who would otherwise avoid or evade tax altogether. This
    Bill lies at the heart of a plan to go on building a prosperous nation.</p><p
    pid=\"a755.0/22\">The Opposition profess to be tough on tax avoidance and evasion,
    to want to tighten up the rules for non-doms, and to want to clamp down on the
    tax gap. The Bill before the House does exactly that. So let the question tonight
    be not simply whether this Bill should proceed but whether Labour Members really
    do wish to deliver on these principles rather than succumb to the easy place of
    opposition for opposition&#8217;s sake&#8212;whether they wish to stand up to
    the avoiders and the evaders, or themselves to avoid and evade their responsibility.
    I commend this Bill to the House.</p><p pid=\"a755.0/23\">Question put, that the

  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="a780.2/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
    Third time.</p><p pid="a780.2/2">The work of HMRC, though typically not seen as
    the most glamorous aspect of government, is arguably the most important. If we
    do not collect tax, we cannot pay for our public services. Every time a new loophole
    opens up in the tax code, that is another school we cannot afford or another nurse
    we cannot employ. That is why since 2010 we have significantly improved HMRC&#8217;s
    ability to fight tax avoidance and evasion, and we have raised &#163;160 billion
    in so doing. That is a far stronger record than in the 13 years during which Labour
    was in government, but the work is never over.</p><p pid="a780.2/3">In this Finance
    Bill, we are going further than ever to make sure that people pay their fair share.
    First, we are tackling disguised remuneration schemes by introducing new charges
    on those artificial loans. Secondly, we are updating the rules on how large companies
    account for the cost of interest, bringing to an end excessive interest expenses
    claims. Finally, we are giving HMRC the greater  powers it needs to punish avoidance
    enablers effectively. Taken together, the changes will advance our fight against
    aggressive tax avoidance.</p><p pid="a780.2/4">Alongside our avoidance and evasion
    work, the Government are committed to making the tax system fairer as a whole.
    In the Bill, we are bringing to an end permanent non-dom status. There can and
    should be no denying that non-doms have made a great contribution to our prosperity,
    but permanent non-dom status can be unfair to UK-domiciled citizens. From now
    on, with the abolition of non-dom status, those who have lived in the UK for years
    will pay UK tax in the same way as everybody else does.</p><p pid="a780.2/5">The
    Government recognise that we need to move with the times, and part of that is
    our work on making tax digital. Every year, the Exchequer loses more than &#163;8
    billion in avoidable errors. By making tax digital and easing communications between
    HMRC, businesses and the self-employed, that loss will be significantly reduced.
    To help businesses to adjust, we will go forward with a gradual process, as I
    set out in my written statement. We are confident that the timetable is the right
    one.</p><p pid="a780.2/6">I would like to take a moment to thank Members on both
    sides of the House for their scrutiny of the Bill on Second Reading and in Committee.
    The debate has been broad and thorough, and I am particularly grateful to the
    Labour and Scottish National party Front Benchers for the courtesy and consideration
    that they have shown me and for their contributions to the debate.</p><p pid="a780.2/7">I
    would like to make one or two final observations. It is, of course, the duty of
    the Opposition to oppose, to scrutinise and to hold the Government to account,
    and there has been much good, positive scrutiny from the Opposition&#8212;some
    of it of the highest quality&#8212;during proceedings on the Bill. But it is,
    surely, also the duty of the Opposition to do so responsibly and without taking
    us too far from the facts or too deep into the politics. Where that occurs&#8212;for
    example, with the branding of all non-doms as tax dodgers, when many are far from
    wealthy and always pay their tax in the UK&#8212;it corrodes this country&#8217;s
    competitiveness and our reputation for fair play. If our clamping down on tax
    abuse around termination payments&#8212;typically for those who receive the largest
    payments of all&#8212;is presented as punishing those who have lost their jobs,
    it just frightens people. That approach is wrong. The Government stand squarely
    behind positively supporting our economy and all who work in it, and we always
    will. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

    by the acceleration in their retirement age. I am saddened that we are having

    Second time.</p><p pid="c68.2/2">The Chancellor recently set out a bold and forward-looking
    autumn Budget. It reflected and responded to current circumstances, and it will
    build a Britain that is fit for the future. The UK economy has shown great resilience.
    Our GDP growth has remained solid, continuing for more than 19 quarters. Employment
    has risen by 3 million since 2010 and is close to a record high, while unemployment
    is at its lowest rate since 1975. Those employment trends are not being felt only
    in the south-east. Indeed, since 2010, 75% of the fall in unemployment has occurred
    elsewhere, and the biggest falls in the unemployment rate took place in Yorkshire
    and Humber, and in Wales.</p><p pid="c68.2/3">The deficit has been reduced by
    three quarters from 9.9% of GDP in 2009-10&#8212;that figure was a shocking indictment
    of the last Labour Government&#8212;to 2.3% of GDP in 2016-17. In the coming years,
    borrowing is set to fall even further, reaching 1.1% of GDP in 2022-23, which
    will be the lowest level since 2001-02. However, at 86.5% of GDP, public debt
    is still too high and productivity growth remains subdued. This Budget therefore
    balanced short-term action with long-term investment, while rightly sticking to
    the principles of social responsibility that will continue to improve the health
    of our public finances, with our debt due to start falling from next year.</p>

    At this stage, no one can be entirely certain what the structure of our future
    relations with the European Union will be, but the Labour party is clear that
    the country cannot be left without the capacity to defend our manufacturing industry
    against unfair trading practices. Indeed, many Opposition Members will wish that
    the Government had been more keenly aware of the need for strong action on trade
    defence when our steel industry was put into crisis by the unfair dumping of Chinese
    steel, or when the United States took entirely unjustified action against Bombardier
    in Northern Ireland.</p><p pid="a221.0/5">The need for a Bill to establish a trade
    remedies authority, to establish our independent membership of the WTO government
    procurement agreement, to enable us to maintain strong trading ties with partner
    countries that have had historical agreements with us through the EU, and to establish
    the power to collect and share trade information&#8212;all are uncontroversial
    requirements. However, the way in which the Government have gone about this process
    is not uncontroversial; it is quite the opposite.</p><p pid="a221.0/6">On the
    face of it, this is a modest little Bill that has a lot to be modest about. The
    four things that the Bill does, it does badly. But what is worse is that the one
    thing it absolutely should have done well&#8212;namely, to provide appropriate
    parliamentary scrutiny and oversight of our country&#8217;s trade agreements&#8212;it
    fails to do entirely.</p><p pid="a221.0/7">We were repeatedly told that the Trade

    does not do that. Instead, it represents yet another attempt by the Government
    to appropriate to themselves powers that should by rights be afforded to Parliament.</p><p
    pid="a221.0/10">I must acknowledge my bias: I voted to remain in the EU and I
    think our country has embarked on an act of economic self-harm. But I am 100%
    certain that those of our fellow citizens who did vote to leave the EU did not
    vote for sovereign powers to be taken away from the bureaucrats, as they regarded
    them, in Brussels, only to be handed over to the Secretary of State for International
    Trade. They thought&#8212;indeed, they were told&#8212;that we were taking back
    control to our sovereign Parliament, yet the Bill contains Henry VIII powers that

  full_motion_speech: <p pid="a208.2/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a
    Second time.</p><p pid="a208.2/2">Free and fair trade is fundamental to the prosperity
    of the United Kingdom&#8212;that is something on which both sides of the House
    can agree. As globalisation and new technology have changed the face of the world
    economy, the old barriers of distance and time have been eroded. In an age in
    which data, knowledge and expertise are traded as readily as cars and steel, even
    the simplest transactions are no longer confined to one country or even one continent.
    The United Kingdom is one of the world&#8217;s leading trading nations. The total
    value of our trade with the rest of the world is equivalent to over half our gross
    domestic product. The UK is the most popular destination for foreign direct investment
    in Europe, and last year FDI created or safeguarded an estimated 108,000 new jobs.
    British companies operate across the globe with an international reputation for
    quality and expertise that few nations can match. That has enabled us to boost
    the total value of our exports by around 14% in the past year to some &#163;617
    billion.</p><p pid="a208.2/3">Our current success is built on a long and proud
    trading tradition. From our unilateral adoption of free trade in the 1840s to
    our instrumental role in founding the World Trade Organisation, the United Kingdom
    has been at the heart of international trading innovations. Often, we have led
    the way, using our economic and diplomatic influence to guide the world towards
    a free trading future, confident in the benefits that the rules-based global trading
    system can bestow. For more than four decades, the United Kingdom has been unable
    to fulfil that leadership role, but soon this country will once again be able
    to pursue an independent trade policy, whether unilaterally or within bodies such
    as the WTO. We will be able to unlock some of the key areas of global growth,
    to offer preferential market access to developing nations of our choosing, to
    develop closer economic links with our Commonwealth partners and to influence,
    as we once did, the future of international trade.</p>

    pid="a1008.1/3">I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the way you have made sure that these

    and I thank all those who have contributed. I have to thank the Secretary of State
    for the courteous way he has always behaved in his dealings with us in this Chamber
    and of course elsewhere&#8212;we do not take that for granted.</p><p pid="a1008.1/4">It
    grieves me to have to move the SNP&#8217;s reasoned amendment that would decline
    the Bill a Third Reading because I would like to be in a situation in which we
    were not doing so. Over the past five months, we have seen the Government ducking
    and diving any responsibility for the legal and constitutional make-up of the
    UK by railroading through Parliament a car-crash plan to leave the EU.</p><p pid="a1008.1/5">The
    Secretary of State for Scotland should be ashamed of himself. First, he promised
    the people of Scotland that the Bill would result in a powers bonanza; then he
    slapped us with clause 11&#8212;the now famous power-grab element of the legislation&#8212;the
    extent of which is not only staggering but an absolute constitutional outrage.
    Even <phrase class="honfriend" name="Paul Masterton" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25654">the
    hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Paul Masterton)</phrase>, who is in his place,
    has been clear, noting in this House that</p><p class="indent" pid="a1008.1/6"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;clause 11&#8230;is not fit for purpose&#8221;.&#8212;[Official
    Report, <phrase class="date" code="2018-12-04">4 December</phrase> 2017; Vol.
    632, c. 731.]</p><p pid="a1008.1/7">In 1997, the people of Scotland voted for
    the reconvening of the Scottish Parliament. Clause 11 represents a massive power
    grab that undermines the very principles on which the Scottish Parliament was
    established. The Scottish Government have published a list of 111 powers that
    are at risk from the clause, and just last week the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s
    Finance and Constitution Committee agreed unanimously not to recommend that the
    Scottish Parliament give legislative consent to the Bill. The Committee found
    clause 11 to be incompatible with devolution.</p><p pid="a1008.1/8">The Secretary
    of State for Scotland himself admitted that the Bill needed to be amended, which
    brings me to the latest insult that the Government have afforded to all the people
    of Scotland. In December, the Secretary of State promised that the Government
    would table amendments to clause 11 on Report. Report has obviously passed and
    not one single promised Government amendment was tabled to clause 11. Statements
    and promises made at the Dispatch Box cannot be sidestepped or ignored. The failure
    to deliver on commitments made at the Dispatch Box undermines the integrity of
    political office and undermines our democracy, never mind the democratic rights
    of the devolved institutions that we are seeking to protect. I am not talking
    about some abstract principle; I am talking about the rights hard won and delivered
    with, for example, the passing of the Scotland Act 1998, which brought in devolution.
    It is an insult to the people of Scotland, who are growing weary of a Conservative
    Government who promise everything and deliver nothing.</p><p pid="a1008.1/9">Last
    night, we saw the Scottish Tories traipse through the Lobby under the command
    of their London leader. They are just Lobby fodder here. How will they explain
    themselves to their branch manager in Holyrood? The Bill will carry on to the
    House of Lords. It is almost as if the Government are now acting as the independence
    movement for Scotland. The arrogance of those who think that the introduction
    of amendments on the legislative competence of the democratically elected Scottish
    Parliament can be implemented by unelected peers is an affront to democracy.</p><p
    pid="a1008.1/10">I echo some of the fundamental concerns about other parts of
    the Bill that only compound our opposition to it. There have been some dignified
    and honourable speeches from Members during the Bill&#8217;s journey so far, but
    the Government&#8217;s approach to the Bill and their attitude in respect of clause
    11 is simply not good enough. A wise man once said that having a majority of seats
    did not mean having a monopoly on wisdom. I call on the Prime Minister to heed
    that advice. The Bill needs to be changed fundamentally, and the Government need
    to adopt a new approach fast, or they will trigger a constitutional crisis of
    their own making.</p><p pid="a1008.1/11">Conservatives should remember that their
    standing in face of demands for the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament
    contributed to the wipeout of Conservative MPs from Scotland in 1997. What happened
    yesterday was a failure of the Government and Scottish Tory MPs to defend our
    national interests and those of their own constituents. History is repeating itself.
    What are the Scottish Tories here for? Will they join us in standing up for Scotland&#8217;s
    interests? Tonight, by supporting our reasoned amendment, Parliament has the opportunity
    to remove itself from encroaching on the devolution settlement. Members of this
    House have the opportunity to protect the constitutional rights of devolved Administrations.
    We cannot allow the responsibility for digging the Government out of their task
    in this House to be taken by the House of Lords.</p><p pid="a1008.1/12">In conclusion&#8212;[Interruption.]
    The Tories can cheer, but the fact remains that the people of Scotland will be
    watching and will be aware of the fact that the Scottish Parliament has been stripped
    of its rights. In declining a Third Reading this evening, we send a clear signal
    to the Government that this House cannot allow the commitments made and broken
    to pass. It is the last chance for Scottish Tory MPs to join us and to stand up
    for the devolved settlement. It is for the people of Scotland to determine their
    constitutional future. We cannot pass that power to the unelected House of Lords.
    The irony that the Lords, not the Commons, has the responsibility for protecting
    Scotland&#8217;s interests will not be lost on people. I say to the Scottish Tory
    MPs that they should join us in the Lobby tonight or ultimately pay the price.
    Scotland is watching.</p>

    a concept&#8212;an important one but one that seemed a long way off. We have come
    a long way since. In February 2017, Parliament granted powers to construct phase
    1 of the scheme, from London to the west midlands, and works on part of this route
    have now begun. This project is now a developing reality. We came a step closer
    to an operating railway when we announced the shortlist of companies that will

    of this vital project. Phase 2a extends HS2 from the west midlands to Crewe. The
    first stage of the new line, which will take the midlands engine through to the
    northern powerhouse, connecting the two together, will accelerate construction
    of the first section of phase 2 by six years and bring us a step closer to delivering
    a complete brand-new high-speed line all the way to Manchester. That is the importance
    of today&#8217;s debate. It is this link that will take the railway line towards
    Manchester&#8212;finally to one of our great cities and industrial centres of

    nation-wide property-owning democracy.&#8221;</p><p pid="a290.0/4">That conviction
    is as strong now as it was when Anthony Eden first said those words in 1946, but
    it is obvious to all of us in the House that the ideal has been eroded, and that
    the next generation of potential homeowners are being shut out. In London, prices
    are nearly 13 times the average wage, and in the rest of England they are eight
    times the average wage. Home ownership has decreased by 20 percentage points among
    young people in just the last 15 years. This Government know that the most sustainable
    way to improve affordability is by increasing supply. That is why at the autumn
    Budget we took steps to address this. We announced the Letwin review to look at
    why planning permissions are not turning into homes, and we increased Government
    funding for new housing to &#163;44 billion over the next five years.</p><p pid="a290.0/5">But
    there are also things we can do in the short term to help young people in particular
    to get a foot on to the ladder, so this Bill provides for a stamp duty cut for
    first-time buyers. First-time buyers tend to be more cash-constrained than others,
    with stamp duty representing a key financial obstacle, on top of a deposit and
    conveyancing fees for purchases over &#163;125,000. This Bill will help more people
    to negotiate these challenges and exempts first-time buyers from stamp duty for
    houses worth up to &#163;300,000, and it provides discounts for houses worth up
    to &#163;500,000. This will save homebuyers up to &#163;5,000 and will mean 80%
    of first-time buyers will not pay any stamp duty.</p><p pid="a290.0/6">This Government
    have presided over 20 successive quarters of economic growth, record levels of
    employment and a significant decrease in the Budget deficit, as well as among
    the lowest levels of unemployment in over 40 years. This has been achieved only
    because of fair and sustainable fiscal and economic policy, but Britain&#8217;s
    productivity growth is subdued and has been since 2008, and I hardly need to tell
    the House why this should concern us, for productivity is intimately linked to
    real incomes and to living standards. That is why in this Bill we are increasing
    the research and development expenditure credit from 11% to 12%, thereby increasing
    incentives to businesses to invest in R&amp;D. We also need to encourage our entrepreneurs
    and help their bright ideas to become productive business, but, as Sir Damon  Buffini
    pointed out in the &#8220;Patient Capital Review&#8221;, it is often those companies
    at the forefront of technological and knowledge-based development with the most
    productive potential that struggle for necessary capital. In this Bill we are
    therefore increasing the lifetime investment limit for knowledge-intensive companies
    through our venture capital schemes from &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million,
    and we are doubling the yearly amount an investor can put into these schemes to
    &#163;2 million, provided that everything over &#163;1 million is invested in
    knowledge-intensive businesses. Building an economy fit for the future relies
    on our harnessing technology, new ideas, and the expertise we already have; these
    changes will help to make that happen.</p><p pid="a290.0/7">The Government will
    continue to work relentlessly to make our tax system fairer and more sustainable,
    and this Bill continues the Government&#8217;s work on tax avoidance and evasion,
    making sure that people pay their fair share. Since 2010 the Government have introduced
    over 100 avoidance and evasion measures, which have helped to secure and protect
    over &#163;175 billion of additional tax revenues to go towards our vital public
    services. But the work is not done, and this Bill furthers that agenda, cracking
    down on online VAT evasion, making online marketplaces joint and severally liable
    for the unpaid VAT of their sellers, and preventing companies from claiming unfair
    tax relief on their intellectual property. Taken together, the measures in the
    Bill to tackle avoidance and evasion raise further vital funds for our public
    services.</p><p pid="a290.0/8">I thank Members for the quality of the debate during
    the passage of this Bill, and I thank in particular the Bill Committee and those
    on the Opposition Front Benches, both Labour and Scottish National parties, for
    their professional scrutiny and the fair and effective way in which they conducted
    themselves.</p><p pid="a290.0/9">This Bill is one of which this Government can
    be proud. It gives first-time buyers renewed hope of a place on the housing ladder,
    puts measures in place to boost productivity, and takes another step along the
    path towards an equitable and sustainable tax system. I commend the Bill to the
    House.</p>

    is, frankly, a desperate state of affairs. We are two years on from the referendum
    and five months away from the deadline for the withdrawal deal, but the Government
    still cannot agree on the most basic of Brexit issues: our future customs arrangements.
    Each week we see a new attempt, and each week we see it fail, with a Cabinet&#8212;a
    war Cabinet&#8212;and two Sub-Committees of warring factions. Yesterday we at
    least saw some agreement: the agreement to kick the ball down the road for another
    month as the Government agreed to publish a White Paper on their negotiating position,
    but without any agreement on what will be in it.</p><p pid="b341.0/4">The Prime
    Minister is clearly in a difficult position. Every time she tries to make progress,
    a Cabinet Minister is waiting to trip her up. As an Opposition, it is tempting
    for us to dwell on the Government&#8217;s misfortune but, frankly, this is too
    important. The lives of millions of people across the country depend on us getting
    Brexit right, and if the Government cannot, Parliament needs to take responsibility,
    because there is a majority in this House that believes in a sensible approach
    to delivering the decision of the referendum. That starts with our customs arrangements,
    which is why we have tabled this Humble Address motion to seek the publication
    of the papers and analysis on the Government&#8217;s two post-Brexit customs options:
    the Prime Minister&#8217;s favoured proposal of a customs partnership, which has
    of course been dismissed by the Foreign Secretary as &#8220;crazy&#8221;; and
    the so-called &#8220;maximum facilitation&#8221; option, which the Secretary of
    State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy rightly warned would put jobs
    at risk. Both have faced serious criticisms of their technical detail and may
    be illegal, according to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister
    for the Cabinet Office.</p><p pid="b341.0/5">The Brexit Secretary, who is unfortunately
    not in the Chamber, has dismissed the customs partnership as &#8220;blue sky thinking&#8221;,
    but when looking at the maximum facilitation option, I was struck by his words.
    I want to quote him precisely:</p><p class="indent" pid="b341.0/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Faced
    with intractable problems with political pressure for a solution, the government
    reaches for a headline grabbing high-tech &#8216;solution&#8217;. Rather than
    spend the resources, time and thought necessary to get a real answer, they naively
    grasp solutions that to the technologically illiterate ministers look like magic.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b341.0/7">Those were the words of the Brexit Secretary. As it happens, he
    was speaking in 2008 about ID cards, but was he not prophetic in anticipating
    today&#8217;s &#8220;intractable&#8221; problem? However, it is not intractable;
    there is a solution.</p><p pid="b341.0/8">It is clear to everyone that the Government
    are in a total mess, locked in a fight over two options, neither of which is practical
    or acceptable to the EU, but this House has an opportunity to sort out the mess.
    There is a majority that respects both the result of the referendum  and our duty
    to protect the livelihoods of the people we represent. <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Stephen Crabb" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11768">The right hon.
    Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Stephen Crabb)</phrase> rightly described the
    conflict in the Cabinet as an &#8220;ideological cage fight&#8221;, adding that
    Parliament may soon be &#8220;making the decisions&#8221;. Frankly, it would make
    a better job of it. There is a majority for a new and comprehensive customs union,
    both here and beyond the House, among all those who recognise the importance of
    protecting our manufacturing sector, of securing frictionless trade with the EU,
    and of honouring our obligations on the Good Friday agreement and the border in
    Ireland.</p>'

    the Rt hon Member for Epsom and Ewell, for his handling of the East Coast franchise
    and his proposal to re-privatise the route rather than operate it as a public
    sector operation; and calls on the Government to reduce his ministerial salary
    by &#163;2,400 per year.</p><p pid="c851.1/3">Labour has brought forward today&#8217;s
    motion because of the lack of candour and lack of debate around the future of
    the east coast franchise, both inside this House and outside. Not for the first
    time, the Secretary of State for Transport has fallen desperately short in matters
    of clarity and courtesy in his ministerial conduct. I believe that manners maketh
    the man and manners also maketh the Minister.</p><p pid="c851.1/4">I would like
    to take this opportunity to advise the House that a week ago today I was denied
    the usual courtesy of being furnished with a copy of the Minister&#8217;s statement
    at least 45 minutes before the statement was made. I was allowed sight of the
    statement at 12.15 pm in an ante room on the upper ministerial corridor. I was
    not permitted to retain a copy and simply had to grab the few minutes afforded
    to me to make brief handwritten notes. With Prime Minister&#8217;s questions scheduled
    to finish at 12.45 pm and there being no other business before the House, that
    gave me the briefest sight of the document that I was to respond to.</p><p pid="c851.1/5">To
    add insult to injury, I was not even provided with a hard copy of the statement
    as it was being delivered at the Dispatch Box. I noted that you, Mr Speaker, did
    have the benefit of a hard copy of the Secretary of State&#8217;s statement as
    he delivered it, but sadly I did not have that luxury.</p>

    now lose 5% of costs for every treatment, and when the Government have refused
    time and again to give the NHS the funding required, we see patients suffering
    every day in our constituencies. That is why we have just suffered the worst winter
    in the history of the NHS, when our hospitals were overcrowded and our A&amp;E
    departments were logjammed. The number of hospitals operating at the highest emergency
    alert level&#8212;the OPEL 4 level&#8212;was nearly double what it was the year
    before, which itself was branded a humanitarian crisis.</p><p pid="c904.0/7">In

    to you, Mr Speaker, for having enabled this amendment to be considered this afternoon
    by accepting my manuscript. It is a very odd and, I have to say, unsatisfactory
    aspect of the way in which our Parliament does its business that we frequently
    end up on ping-pong debating amendments that are irrelevant to what the House
    is really troubled about. I have to tell the House that, in order to get to this
    point, it has been necessary also to twist the rules of procedure in the other
    place, and I am immensely grateful to those peers who facilitated the manuscript
    amendment that was tabled there and that has enabled us to consider for the first
    time this afternoon the issue of the meaningful vote in relation to the Government&#8217;s
    view of what it should be and to the suggestion that has come from their lordships&#8217;
    House. I should like to say here and now how deeply I object to the way in which
    their lordships are vilified for doing the job that we have asked them to do,
    which is to act as a revising Chamber and to send back to this House proposals
    for our consideration.</p><p pid="a367.0/3">The issue, which has been highlighted
    by earlier speakers, is about the form that a meaningful vote should take. There
    are two options in front of the House. The House will recall that, when this matter
    first arose last week, the amendment that had come from the Lords included a mandatory
    element. That is constitutionally rather unusual. Indeed, I do not think that
    it has happened since the civil war in the 17th century, and I do not think that
    that ended very well. I seem to recall that it ended with Oliver Cromwell saying:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="a367.0/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Take away that fool&#8217;s
    bauble, the mace.&#8221;</p><p pid="a367.0/5">Because of this, I considered it
    to be excessive. I apologise to the House that, in trying to produce something
    else very late at night last week, I probably did not draft it quite as well as
    I might have done. However, it led to a  sensible discussion, prompted by my right
    hon. Friend the Prime Minister, who had a number of us in her room and said she
    would do her best to meet the concerns we were expressing on there not being a
    meaningful vote on no deal.</p><p pid="a367.0/6">Last Thursday, it looked as though
    we were going to reach an agreement based on exactly the terms of the Lords amendment
    that has come back to us, but at a very late stage, it was indicated to me that
    the Government did not feel able to proceed with that. I should like to emphasise
    that I make absolutely no criticism of those with whom I negotiated, who have
    behaved impeccably in this matter. Indeed, at the end of the day I have to accept
    that negotiations may sometimes founder at the last minute. However, this was
    unfortunate, from my point of view, and I will come back to that point in a moment.</p><p
    pid="a367.0/7">Be that as it may, the Government&#8217;s tabled amendment was
    the one that we are being asked to accept today&#8212;the one that simply asks
    us to note and does not give us the opportunity of amending. Two arguments were
    put to me to justify that change when it occurred and in the negotiations that
    followed. The first was that there was concern about the justiciability of the
    amendment. The Standing Orders of the House cannot be impugned in any court outside
    of this high court of Parliament, but it is right to say that if one puts a reference
    to the Standing Orders into a statute, that can raise some interesting, if somewhat
    arcane, legal issues about the extent to which a challenge can be brought. My
    view  is that I do not believe that the amendment, which is currently the Lords
    amendment that has come to us, is credibly open to challenge. For that matter,
    I happen to think that the Government amendment is also not credibly open to challenge
    either, although it is worth pointing out that it is as likely to be challenged
    or capable of being challenged as the other. I do not accept a differentiation
    between them.</p><p pid="a367.0/8">The second argument was of a very different
    kind. It was said to me&#8212;this was picked up by the Opposition Front-Bench
    spokesman&#8212;that the Government had real concerns that this issue, which is
    one of detail, had acquired such a status with those with whom we were negotiating
    that it could undermine the Government&#8217;s negotiating position in trying
    to get the United Kingdom the best possible deal for leaving the EU. Now, I must
    say that I found that difficult to accept based on my own range of contacts and
    on how I thought that the EU is likely to work. However, it is not an issue that
    I, as a supporter of the Government, can entirely ignore.</p><p pid="a367.0/9">I
    am very troubled about Brexit. It is well known in this House that I believe that
    we have made an historic mistake in voting to leave, but I am open minded as to
    what the best course of action should be and respectful of the decision of the
    electorate in the referendum result. I dislike very much the extent to which we
    can be fettered or pushed into frameworks of what we have or have not to accept
    in that negotiation but that is, if I may so, a reason why I should also give
    as much latitude to the concerns of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister as
    she indicates to me that she might have.</p>

    world.</p><p pid="d649.1/4">Let me explain to Members what we are doing today.
    The proposed policy statement does not grant final planning consent; what it does
    is set the policy against which a promoter of an expanded Heathrow airport can
    deliver more detailed design and participate in the detailed planning process
    that can lead to final consent.</p><p pid="d649.1/5">I thank the many Members
    on both sides of the House who have gone on the record to support expansion at
    Heathrow, and who have made considerable efforts to persuade others of its importance
    to all nations and regions of the United Kingdom. I know that this debate is divisive
    for many, but there is also strong support across the House for what I believe
    is a very important step for our nation, and I am grateful to all those who have
    been involved in supporting the way forward that I believe is right for our country.</p>

    Members from across the House who have shared their time and expertise to help

    line-by-line scrutiny in Public Bill Committee. I would like to thank those who
    gave oral evidence to the Committee, and the individuals and organisations who
    provided written evidence and recommendations. I also extend particular thanks
    to the members of the Committee, on which <phrase class="honfriend" name="Barry

    thanks to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Greg Hands" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11610">the

    for Trade Policy played a vital role in developing the Bill and in steering it
    through the preceding parliamentary stages. I, and all my parliamentary colleagues,
    owe him a great debt.</p><p pid="b358.2/3">This is an important Bill. It provides
    continuity and stability as the UK leaves the European Union for individuals,
    businesses and our international trading partners. It will be the confident first
    step that the UK  takes towards establishing itself as an independent training
    nation for the first time in over 40 years. As the hon. Member for Brent North
    concluded on Second Reading:</p><p class="indent" pid="b358.2/4" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The
    need for a Bill to establish a trade remedies authority, to establish our independent
    membership of the WTO government procurement agreement, to enable us to maintain
    strong trading ties with partner countries that have had historical agreements
    with us through the EU, and to establish the power to collect and share&#8230;information&#8212;all
    are uncontroversial requirements.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date"
    code="2018-01-09">9 January</phrase> 2018; Vol. 634, c. 221.]</p><p pid="b358.2/5">I
    wholeheartedly concur.</p><p pid="b358.2/6">As the UK leaves the EU, the Government
    are committed to seeking continuity in our current trade relationships. One way
    we will achieve this is by introducing powers to let us make domestic legislation
    implementing our independent membership of the Agreement on Government Procurement,
    or GPA. This continuity is important for both business and the taxpayer. GPA membership
    will maintain the access of UK businesses to a global public procurement market
    estimated at &#163;1.3 trillion every year, across major economies such as the
    United States, Canada and Japan.</p><p pid="b358.2/7">Taxpayers and users of public
    services will also benefit. The GPA has led to increased choice, quality and value
    for money in the public sector. TheCityUK, which represents financial and related
    professional services, wrote to the Public Bill Committee to say:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="b358.2/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We fully recognise the need for the UK
    to become a party to the WTO GPA&#8221;.</p><p pid="b358.2/9">As it explained:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="b358.2/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The GPA requires that
    open, fair and transparent conditions of competition be ensured in government
    procurement&#8230;which cover both goods and services&#8221;.</p><p pid="b358.2/11">The
    Federation of Small Businesses said:</p><p class="indent" pid="b358.2/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;it
    is essential that the UK is able to become an independent member of the GPA, allowing
    small businesses to have continued access to government contracts and procurement
    opportunities.&#8221;</p><p pid="b358.2/13">It is clear that the agreement is
    of great value to UK businesses and its importance is endorsed by organisations
    representing their interests.</p><p pid="b358.2/14">As an EU member, the UK participates
    in many trade agreements with partner countries. We want continuity as far as
    possible in our existing trading relationships with these existing partners. As
    these agreements account for 12% of the UK&#8217;s total international trade,
    this will be important in preventing disruption to businesses, consumers and workers.
    The International Trade Committee observed in a recent report that:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="b358.2/15" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Almost no one who contributed to our
    inquiry suggested that the Government&#8217;s policy objective of seeking continuity
    was the wrong one.&#8221;</p><p pid="b358.2/16">Additionally, the Scotch Whisky
    Association, which I have much pleasure in promoting at home and abroad, has said
    that</p><p class="indent" pid="b358.2/17" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;continuity
    of current EU trade agreements is vitally important to us&#8221;.</p><p pid="b358.2/18">British
    Sugar stated:</p><p class="indent" pid="b358.2/19" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We
    support the Government&#8217;s overriding intention to maintain continuity by
    replicating existing trade as closely as possible and believe that this is the
    best means by which to provide certainty to business.&#8221;</p><p pid="b358.2/20">Continuity
    for the taxpayer, businesses, consumers and our international partners&#8212;that
    is what this Bill is about. To be absolutely clear, and as I made clear in my  statement
    yesterday, this Bill is not about signing new trade agreements or making substantial
    changes to existing ones.</p><p pid="b358.2/21">Despite many misleading claims
    to the contrary, the Government will not use measures in the Bill to implement
    substantially different agreements with existing partner countries. Our policy
    has always been, and remains, one of securing continuity first and seeking new
    opportunities second. We have been clear with our trading partners that continuity
    remains our primary objective, as I made clear earlier this evening. However,
    as debated on Report, to further reassure the House, the Trade Bill requires the
    Secretary of State to table a report outlining all the changes made to existing
    agreements as part of the transition into UK-only agreements. This places in statute
    the Government&#8217;s clear commitment to transparency&#8212;to aid appropriate
    parliamentary involvement, allowing Members of both Houses of Parliament the opportunity
    to see what changes have been made to secure continuity.</p><p pid="b358.2/22">Additionally,
    the use of the clause 2 power will now be subject to the affirmative resolution
    procedure, allowing both Houses to debate regulations made under that power. The
    Government will not use the powers in the Bill to implement the obligations of
    new free trade agreements&#8212;ones with countries with whom the EU does not
    already have a free trade agreement. We consider these to be future trade agreements
    and we announced this week our proposals for them.</p><p pid="b358.2/23">The Bill
    also provides for the establishment of the Trade Remedies Authority. The World
    Trade Organisation allows its members to provide a safety net to protect domestic
    industries against injury caused by unfair trading practices, such as dumping
    and subsidies, and unforeseen surges in imports. Trade remedies level the playing
    field and restore the competitive balance. They are key to ensuring an effective
    rules-based system for international trade. The European Commission is currently
    responsible for undertaking trade remedies investigations and imposing measures
    on behalf of the UK. The Government are establishing the TRA to ensure that the
    UK can continue to provide a safety net for domestic industries after we have
    left the EU. I am grateful to Members on both sides of the House for the support
    that they have given on this issue.</p><p pid="b358.2/24">Specifically, the TRA
    will be responsible for making an assessment in a case for a trade remedies measure,
    based on the evidence available. It will then make impartial recommendations to
    Ministers. This includes protection from goods that are heavily subsidised or
    dumped in the UK market at below domestic price. It also includes injury caused
    by unforeseen surges in imports. The investigative and decision-making framework
    that the TRA will be responsible for delivering is set out in the Taxation (Cross-border
    Trade) Bill.</p><p pid="b358.2/25">The Government&#8217;s commitment to establishing
    the TRA has been recognised by stakeholders&#8212;by both producers and consumers.

    also ensure that the UK is able to fulfil its international transparency obligations

  question: Question put, That the amendment be made.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move amendment (a), in paragraph (4), leave out from “Report;”
    to the end.
  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="b641.0/1">I beg to move amendment (a), in paragraph
    (4), leave out from &#8220;Report;&#8221; to the end.</p><p pid="b641.0/2">I wish
    to begin by paying tribute to the work of the Leader of the House and her colleagues
    on the steering group. The Select Committee on Standards has worked very closely
    with the steering group on the various work-streams over the past few months.
    There is one issue over which we disagree, and I have tabled an amendment to deal
    with it, which I will come to shortly. Because I and some of my Committee colleagues
    have tabled that amendment, under the rules of procedure we are not able to put
    our names to the main motion; otherwise, I personally would certainly have done
    so.</p><p pid="b641.0/3">I want to emphasise that, this one area apart, the Standards
    Committee is completely in accord with the steering group and its delivery report.
    We strongly support the work that has been done to bring Parliament into the modern
    age in terms of personal conduct. This is not about complicated rules or codes
    or Standing Orders; it is about ordinary human decency.</p><p pid="b641.0/4">People
    should not bully or harass other people. They should not sexually harass them
    or abuse their power. That is obvious, and yet not everyone in this institution
    has behaved in a morally decent way. Parliament should be giving a lead on this,
    but we have been lagging behind. The Standards Committee made a big effort some
    years ago to expand the code of conduct to include some aspects of personal behaviour,
    but this was undermined when it came to be decided in the House by what I may
    call today &#8220;the forces of reaction&#8221;. Now we have another chance, and
    we must take it.</p><p pid="b641.0/5">The Committee set out its views in a report
    published last week. This focuses on matters which are the direct responsibility
    of the Committee&#8212;in particular, complaints against Members and the role
    of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. We have worked with the steering
    group to develop proposals to ensure that Members are properly held to account
    while maintaining an independent, fair, trusted and effective process.</p><p pid="b641.0/6">We
    support the new parliamentary behaviour code. We propose that it should be incorporated
    in the Members&#8217; code of conduct, alongside an additional rule stating that:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="b641.0/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;A Member shall treat his
    or her staff, and all those working for or with Parliament with dignity, courtesy
    and respect.&#8221;</p><p pid="b641.0/8">This will ensure that Members can be
    held fully to account for any instances of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment.
    The motion before the House today will achieve that.</p><p pid="b641.0/9">We have
    given a great deal of thought to how the complaints process will work under the
    new system. Clearly it has to be sensitive, and supportive of the people who wish
    to bring forward complaints, but at the same time it must follow the principles
    of natural justice and be fair to the people who are complained about. We believe
    that the new system should build on the strengths  of the existing system, in
    particular the role of the independent parliamentary commissioner, while tackling
    some of its weaknesses. We and the steering group propose that investigations
    relating to complaints against Members should be overseen by the independent commissioner.</p><p
    pid="b641.0/10">In our report, we set out the background of the current commissioner,
    Kathryn Stone, who was recruited on merit through open and fair competition. She
    has a background in child protection and social care, and she has shown independent-mindedness
    in previous posts, including the particularly sensitive posts of commissioner
    of victims and survivors in Northern Ireland, commissioner of the Independent
    Police Complaints Commission and chief legal ombudsman for England and Wales.
    She also ran a charity for victims of crime, including sexual offences, for 11
    years. I have had the privilege of seeing Kathryn in operation, and I have no
    doubt at all that she is a tough-minded person who will be fiercely independent
    in carrying out her new responsibilities.</p><p pid="b641.0/11">The role of the
    Committee on Standards under the new system will be to carry out any appeal function
    that might be required. The ultimate decision on sanctions in serious cases will
    be taken by the House itself on the basis of a report on the case from the Committee,
    with the complainant anonymised and the report subjected to any redactions that
    the Committee considers necessary to protect the complainant. I know that some
    people are sceptical about involving the Committee because they think it will
    be a case of MPs marking their own homework. I have heard that view quite a few
    times in the media. I understand that point of view, but it does not reflect the
    reality of how the Committee operates. In particular, it does not take account
    of the crucial role of our independent lay members. There are now equal numbers
    of lay members and MPs on the Committee.</p><p pid="b641.0/12">The lay members&#8217;
    role is not widely understood. Our report gives more detail on this, and I urge
    Members to read it. In particular, they might like to look at the CVs of the lay
    members, which are set out in the appendix. They are members of the public, chosen
    on merit through open and fair competition, from diverse backgrounds and with
    a wide spread of experience and skills. None of them has been an MP, and nor are
    they in any way part of what people would call the parliamentary establishment.
    In general, the lay members work closely and harmoniously with the elected Members.</p><p
    pid="b641.0/13">The Committee&#8212;like other Select Committees, and arguably
    more than most&#8212;proceeds by consensus. I have chaired other Select Committees
    in this House that have not had the type of consensus that the Committee on Standards
    works to. However, the lay members do not have voting rights&#8212;which we are
    aware of now&#8212;partly because of a concern that to confer such rights on them
    might open the work of the Committee to challenge in the courts. This concern
    is based on the ground that it is not a properly constituted Select Committee
    entitled to the protection of article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689. Notwithstanding
    this, any lay member has the power to append an opinion to a report of the Committee.
    That power has never been exercised, but it has been seen as an essential safeguard
    for the lay members&#8217; independence. Any one of them could at any time express
    an opinion on any of our reports dealing with Members&#8217; conduct, but they
    have never done so because of the consensual way in which we operate and because
    of the fairness with which we adjudicate against Members of the House.</p><p pid="b641.0/14">Indeed,
    there have been only two occasions on which formal votes have been held since
    lay members first joined the Standards Committee. The most recent was in May this
    year. That led us to review our procedures, because there was clearly a flaw in
    the arrangements. Lay members can append an opinion to a Committee report but
    they do not have such a right if the Committee divides on a motion not relating
    to a report. As a general rule, this does not matter because most Committee decisions
    relate to reports. Reports are how we announce our decisions on individual cases.
    However, at the meeting in May, two votes took place on motions relating to the
    commissioner&#8217;s right to start an investigation. This drew attention to the
    fact that lay members had, in those unusual circumstances, no way of putting their
    views on record.</p><p pid="b641.0/15">We have therefore introduced a new system
    of what we call indicative votes. This means that before the Committee has a formal
    vote involving only MPs, it should have a non-binding vote involving the whole
    Committee. We give more detail about this in our report. The motion before the
    House today will make this binding on the Committee, as we requested. In fact,
    the motion goes further than we requested, because it requires indicative votes
    to take place before all Divisions, including those on reports. We discussed this
    in the Committee last Tuesday and we are entirely happy with that. I should repeat
    that the vast majority of Committee decisions are taken by consensus. The point
    of the new procedure is to make it even less likely that things will be pushed
    to a formal vote. I certainly hope that that will be the case.</p><p pid="b641.0/16">I
    should also mention that it would be wrong to think of the Committee as consisting
    of two opposing blocs: lay members and MPs. Except in relation to formal voting,
    both types of members are treated in exactly the same way and we work as a unified
    team. We are aware that indicative votes are an interim measure. Along with a
    majority of my colleagues on the Committee, I would like to see full voting rights
    given to lay members. We have called on the Government to bring forward primary
    legislation to guarantee that free speech in the Committee is protected by parliamentary
    privilege, as set down in the Bill of Rights 1689, in order to allow the extension
    of full voting rights to lay members. I hope that the Government will respond
    positively to this request.</p><p pid="b641.0/17">Finally, I come to the one point
    of disagreement between the Committee and the steering group. This relates to
    the proposal in the motion to change the existing system under which the commissioner
    publishes details of ongoing investigations on her website. We entirely accept
    and support an extension of confidentiality in relation to complaints under the
    new system, particularly in relation to sexual harassment. There is a real need
    to ensure that victims of sexual harassment are given the confidence to use the
    new system, and confidentiality will play an important part in achieving that.
    We set out in detail in our report how this will operate, and we are in agreement
    with the steering group on that.</p><p pid="b641.0/18">The difficulty for us arises
    from the proposal to extend confidentiality to complaints under the existing code
    that relate not to bullying and harassment but to financial misconduct or the
    abuse of House facilities. At the moment, the commissioner announces the names
    of Members when she launches an investigation, along with a brief statement as
    to the nature of the alleged offence. We can see from the commissioner&#8217;s
    annual  report that the vast majority of complaints that go to her never get anywhere
    near to an investigation. They normally involved wild allegations that are made
    without substance or evidence, and they effectively go nowhere. Of those that
    are investigated, very few come to the Committee for adjudication. The commissioner
    rectifies people&#8217;s misapplication of the rules on issues such as the misuse
    of parliamentary envelopes, for example, so we do not see that this is a major
    issue for the House.</p><p pid="b641.0/19">The rules were agreed by the House
    some years ago in the wake of the expenses scandal, and were seen then as an important
    way of demonstrating transparency and openness. I was on the Standards Committee
    from 2005 to 2010, and I was a winger during the expenses scandal. I can tell
    the House that there was a real need for openness at that time, and a real need
    to let the people of this country know that we were being transparent and open
    in our dealings on their behalf. We believe that transparency and openness should
    continue to apply. There is no doubt that if the House votes for the Leader of
    the House&#8217;s motion today without amendment, many people outside will criticise
    us for rolling back the openness that was agreed back in 2010 following the expenses
    scandal.</p>'

    May</phrase> last year, I was woken from my slumber by the tragic news of the

    been out enjoying their day and night at the arena. A member of ISIS chose to
    target them ruthlessly, in a way that showed total discrimination, when they were

    nerve agent on our streets, which sadly led to the death of a British citizen.</p><p
    pid="b713.0/3">The Government did not knee-jerk&#8212;we did not jump, as has
    sometimes happened over the past few decades, to take measures. The Government
    considered the issues, considered our vulnerabilities and not only took strong
    steps to produce a Bill that will help our security forces and our police tackle
    the changing threats, but were determined to be as collaborative as possible throughout
    the legislating process. Tonight, Members will have heard how we rightly accepted
    the observations from the Labour Front Bench and the SNP about some of the measures.
    The Labour party and the Government discussed the streaming of content online
    and came up with a sensible solution to make sure that people who stream horrific
    material are brought to justice.</p><p pid="b713.0/4">This is not an attention-seeking
    Bill; it is a Bill designed to make a difference, to make our streets safer, to
    make our citizens safer and to send a message that one of the reasons the United
    Kingdom is one of the world leaders in counter-terrorism is that we not only learn
    our lessons from every event, but build on the experience of previous Governments.
    Much of the Bill is built on the back of the Terrorism Act 2000, which was brought
    in by the last Labour Government. We have taken the best elements and learned
    from our experiences and the threats to produce a piece of legislation that in
    my view and that of the Government strikes the right balance between liberty,
    individuals&#8217; rights and the security of this nation. It is a balance that
    we do not take for granted and that we review constantly.</p><p pid="b713.0/5">That
    is why this country probably has some of the greatest oversight of its intelligence
    services, ably led by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Dominic Grieve" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10243">the Member for
    Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve)</phrase>, the judicial commissioners, Lord Justice Fulford
    and the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. All of those learned and
    respected individuals take a strong role, as do the Members who sit on the Intelligence
    and Security Committee, in scrutinising the people who are charged with delivering
    the security of this nation. That, coupled with our long adherence to human rights,
    makes me confident that the Bill does not tip the balance in the wrong way, but
    navigates the difficult course that we are faced with, given the emerging technologies,
    to keep people safe.</p>'

    to lift people out of poverty and smooth the transition into work to ensure that
    it always pays. The reality is that universal credit is a vehicle for cuts: cuts
    in support for families with a disabled child for whom the basic rate of support
    is half what it is in tax credits; cuts in support for disabled people in work,
    such as the disabled person who wrote to us saying that they are more than &#163;300

    Amnesty International, the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, the Family Planning
    Association, Marie Stopes International, the End Violence against Women Coalition,
    Women&#8217;s Aid and the TUC.</p><p pid="c140.6/4">Abortion in our country is
    underpinned by the oldest legal framework for any healthcare treatment, with the
    harshest criminal sentences in the developed world for women having an illegal
    abortion. Poland, the USA, Canada and parts of Australia do not criminalise women.
    The law needs to be updated to deal with the advances in women&#8217;s healthcare
    and sex and relationships education, and with the role of the internet&#8212;all
    of which have occurred alongside the changing attitudes in society.</p><p pid="c140.6/5">Our
    current abortion laws date back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861&#8212;back
    to a time when Queen Victoria was on the throne and women were still decades away
    from getting the right to vote. Under the 1861 Act, any woman procuring her own
    miscarriage and anyone assisting her can go to prison for life. In 1967, Parliament
    voted for the Abortion Act, which gave a route for women in England and Wales
    to access abortion legally,&#160;by setting out specific exemptions and conditions,
    including the need for signatures from two doctors agreeing that, for example,
    a termination is necessary to prevent permanent injury to the physical or mental
    health of the pregnant woman. Women&#8217;s lives have been saved in their thousands
    by David Steel&#8217;s 1967 Act, which meant that women no longer had to seek
    out unsafe, unregulated backstreet abortionists.</p><p pid="c140.6/6">So, what
    are the facts about abortion today? One in three women will have an abortion in
    their lifetime. These days, 80% of abortions take place in the first 12 weeks
    of pregnancy and are medically induced by taking tablets, not by surgical procedures.
    It is the only medical procedure that requires the agreement of two doctors. In
    2007, the Science and Technology Committee found no evidence that this requirement</p><p
    class="indent" pid="c140.6/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;serves to safeguard women
    or doctors&#8221;.</p><p pid="c140.6/8">The 1967 Act has never applied to Northern
    Ireland, and the chilling effect of the 1861 Act means that abortion hardly ever
    takes places in Northern Ireland. It is one of the harshest abortion regimes in
    the world, with no abortion available in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal
    abnormality. This is what a woman from Northern Ireland says:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="c140.6/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I spent Christmas Day in casualty with
    my two children. My husband had beaten me to a pulp&#8230;He had repeatedly raped
    me&#8230;Six weeks later I discovered I was pregnant, I could not continue with
    the pregnancy. Knowing my husband would carry out his threats to kill me if he
    found out, I went to my GP who told me abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland
    and refused to help.&#8221;</p><p pid="c140.6/10">Or let us consider Denise&#8217;s
    story. She was told midway through her pregnancy that her baby had Edwards syndrome
    and would not survive. Very ill and unable to travel, Denise was forced to continue
    with her pregnancy because she lived in Northern Ireland. She was repeatedly asked
    about her baby and that, she said, left her feeling tortured. She said:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="c140.6/11" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Every minute, every second
    of the day&#8212;you have to live with the knowledge that the child inside you
    is going to die.&#8221;</p><p pid="c140.6/12">Or imagine being 18-year-old Emma,
    who found out at 20 weeks that her baby had anencephaly and would not survive.
    She could not face traveling to England for an abortion because she wanted to
    be surrounded by her loving family. She had to continue the pregnancy to term
    because she lived in Northern Ireland, and she was eventually induced to give
    birth to her stillborn daughter.</p><p pid="c140.6/13">Then there was the mother
    who found out that her 15-year-old daughter was pregnant and that her abusive
    partner has threatened to</p><p class="indent" pid="c140.6/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;kick
    the baby out and stab it if it is born.&#8221;</p><p pid="c140.6/15">Feeling that
    she had no other option, she bought her daughter abortion tablets online. Seeking
    support for her daughter from their family doctor concerning the abusive relationship&#8212;not
    the abortion&#8212;she now faces a potential prison sentence for trying to help
    her daughter access medical care denied to her by their Government.</p><p pid="c140.6/16">Then
    there is the heartbreaking account this week on Twitter from a Northern Ireland
    woman who has been live-tweeting at @ratherbehome her experience of having to
    travel to England for an abortion. She says this:</p><p class="indent" pid="c140.6/17"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I should be at home, in the privacy of my own home.
    Instead I&#8217;m trying to discreetly bleed in a shitty hotel. There&#8217;s
    no dignity. There&#8217;s no privacy.&#8221;</p><p pid="c140.6/18">These are real-life
    examples of what women in Northern Ireland face&#160;under the current abortion
    law. Consider for a moment the morality of laws that mean that women in Northern
    Ireland seeking an abortion after being impregnated through a sexual crime, rape
    or incest, could face a heavier criminal punishment than the perpetrators&#8212;the
    real criminals.</p><p pid="c140.6/19">This June, the Supreme Court found that
    Northern Ireland&#8217;s current abortion laws breach women&#8217;s human rights
    in Northern Ireland. In February 2018, the United Nations found that thousands
    of women and girls in Northern Ireland are subject to grave and systematic violations
    of their rights, being compelled either to travel outside Northern Ireland for
    a legal abortion or to carry their pregnancy to term. With the Northern Ireland
    Assembly not sitting since January 2017, UK politicians can no longer look away
    while vulnerable women in Northern Ireland, often suffering in desperate circumstances,
    have their human rights breached. As Hillary Clinton said:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="c140.6/20" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Human rights are women&#8217;s rights,
    and women&#8217;s rights are human rights&#8221;.</p><p pid="c140.6/21">Let there
    be no hard borders in the Irish sea over human rights.</p><p pid="c140.6/22">Polling
    research released on <phrase class="date" code="2018-10-10">10 October</phrase>
    2018 by Amnesty International shows that 65% of people in Northern Ireland believe
    that</p><p class="indent" pid="c140.6/23" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;having an
    abortion should not be a crime&#8221;,</p><p pid="c140.6/24">while 66% supported
    the view that in the absence of devolved government,</p><p class="indent" pid="c140.6/25"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Westminster should legislate to reform the law&#8221;.</p><p
    pid="c140.6/26">If Westminster does decriminalise abortion in Northern Ireland,
    it will then be for the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide what abortion provision
    should look like there.</p><p pid="c140.6/27">Meanwhile, even in England and Wales,
    a woman using abortion tablets bought online is committing a criminal offence
    punishable by life imprisonment&#8212;and it is often the most vulnerable women,
    finding it difficult to access termination services, who turn to the internet.
    Women on Web, a doctor-led online medical service, says that&#160;16% of women
    cite domestic or &#8220;honour&#8221; violence, and 8% intimate partner violence,
    as reasons to seek tablets online. Whether in Birmingham, Belfast or Bangor, women
    need a modern, supportive, humane, properly regulated medical regime that encourages
    them to come forward for the best professional advice and treatment, not drives
    them, isolated and scared, into the unregulated internet pills market.</p><p pid="c140.6/28">Therefore,
    my Bill ensures that up to 24 weeks&#8217; foetal gestation, women and clinicians
    would no longer be subject to the criminal law for consensual abortion. The 24-week
    time limit remains, and decriminalisation does not mean the deregulation of abortion:
    safeguards stay in place. My aim is for effective regulation fit for purpose in
    the 21st century. The existing body of law and professional standards governing
    medical procedures would stay. It would remain a crime to offer abortion services
    without being registered to do so, while anyone supplying medication without a
    legal prescription would breach the Human Medicines Regulations 2012. Clinics
    would continue to be registered and subject to Care Quality Commission oversight.</p><p
    pid="c140.6/29">Very importantly, my Bill would also strengthen protection for
    women and target the criminal law on the real criminals. Anyone&#8212;an abusive
    partner, for example &#8212;who ends a pregnancy against a woman&#8217;s wishes
    through violence, or by administering abortion pills without the woman&#8217;s
    knowledge, would be subject to a life sentence. My Bill also protects doctors
    and nurses who conscientiously object to abortion, extending this as a statutory
    right to Northern Ireland.</p><p pid="c140.6/30">It is time to remove Victorian,
    misogynistic stigma from our abortion laws. My aim is simple&#8212;women able
    to choose what happens to their own bodies: confident, not criminalised, supported,
    not stigmatised; women able to access professional advice and medical care that
    is regulated effectively; and an Act of Parliament that is fit for now, not for
    51 years ago, and certainly not for 157 years ago.</p>'

    the Bill.</p><p pid="d63.2/3">I have to give credit to the Financial Secretary
    to the Treasury: he managed to keep his face straight throughout his delivery.
    We had lots of flowery words from him, and I am surprised that we did not have
    phrases in his clich&#233;-ridden speech such as &#8220;sunny uplands&#8221;,
    &#8220;green shoots of recovery&#8221; and &#8220;the end of the rainbow&#8221;.
    Why were those clich&#233;s not in his speech as well?</p><p pid="d63.2/4">We
    have been asked to scrutinise a Finance Bill under the most difficult circumstances
    the Government could create, short of barring the Opposition from actually attending
    the House. The timetable set for the Bill meant we were expected to table amendments
    on Second Reading before the Bill had even been published&#8212;an abuse of power.
    To add insult to injury, printed copies of the explanatory notes to the Bill only
    arrived in the Vote Office earlier today. How busy Members are expected to provide
    proper scrutiny under these conditions is beyond me. It is an abuse of power.
    Worse still, the Government&#8217;s refusal to table an amendment to the law for
    the third Finance Bill in a row means that we will be unable to meaningfully amend
    this proposed legislation following Second Reading. As I said in my speech on
    the Budget resolutions, that is unprecedented. It is another abuse of power.</p><p
    pid="d63.2/5">Last week, the President of the United States fired his Attorney
    General to undermine an investigation against him. Mr Trump also barred a journalist
    asking legitimate questions from the White House. Perhaps he gave the Prime Minister
    the odd tip on how to side-step conventions and constitutional process. Stitching
    up Committees with a false majority, obstructing scrutiny of the Finance Bill
    and giving a &#163;1 billion bung to a minority party to keep the Prime Minister&#8217;s
    Government alive are further abuses of power. In any other country, we would use
    a word for this behaviour: malfeasance, plain and simple.</p><p pid="d63.2/6">This
    is a desperate state of affairs, especially given how much the Bill is in need
    of change. The Government&#8217;s policies announced in the Budget fail to tackle
    a single one of the great challenges now facing this country after eight years
    of austerity. Most notably, this Bill of broken promises fails to end austerity,
    as the Prime Minister said it would during her conference speech&#8212;once she
    had finished gyrating. As our reasoned amendment points out, this promise has
    been broken: &#163;4 billion of Tory social security cuts are still on their way.
    Only half the money cut from universal credit work allowances was returned to
    the programme. There was nothing on the social security freeze or the two-child
    limit.</p>'

    thanking my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney General for putting himself
    at the disposal of the House yesterday for over two hours, to provide information
    about the legal impact of the withdrawal agreement. He did so with his characteristic
    candour and integrity. The use of this motion has happened very rarely in the
    history of Parliament, and I do not think that any Member can be in any doubt
    that the information that the Attorney General provided yesterday was a very frank
    assessment of the legal position. The questions posed by Members on both sides
    of the House addressed the key issues we must all consider on the legal effects
    of the withdrawal agreement. My right hon. and learned Friend responded to all
    those questions in comprehensive fashion.</p><p pid="e669.5/4">Alongside yesterday&#8217;s
    session of nearly two and a half hours, the Government have also provided a 48-page
    legal commentary that sets out the legal effect of each part of the withdrawal
    agreement. The information provided to the House is the detailed legal position
    on the withdrawal agreement and, as the Attorney General said to the House yesterday,
    he continues to be at the disposal of parliamentarians to answer further questions.</p><p
    pid="e669.5/5">I would, therefore, in responding to the contempt motion before
    us today, urge the House to exercise caution in this matter. The issue at hand
    is not one of substantive content. As yesterday&#8217;s questioning illustrated,  there
    is no real dispute as to the meaning and legal effect of the withdrawal agreement.
    The Attorney General could not have been clearer about the legal position yesterday.
    No hon. Member could say in all honesty that the Attorney General has done anything
    other than treat this House with the greatest respect. There can be no question
    that he, or the Government, has acted in a manner that is contemptuous of this
    House.</p>

    November</phrase> this year to publish the final and full legal advice by the

    on <phrase class="date" code="2018-11-13">13 November</phrase> I sought your advice
    on that issue and you ruled in the following terms:</p><p class="indent" pid="e667.2/5"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The ruling I give is simply that the motion is effective&#8212;I
    have been advised thus. It is not just an expression of the opinion of the House;
    it is an expression of the will of the House that certain documents should be
    provided to it.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2018-11-13">13
    November</phrase> 2018; Vol. 649, c. 236.]</p><p pid="e667.2/6">Yesterday, the
    Government published a reasoned position paper. That was not legal advice. It
    simply described the deal: it was a synopsis; it was in the nature of an explainer&#8212;an
    explainer having already been published when the deal was published. It was a
    long way from legal advice. The Attorney General made a statement to the House
    and then answered questions, but the Government did not publish the full and final
    advice by the Attorney General to the Cabinet. That is the long and short of it.
    The Government are wilfully refusing to comply with a binding order of this House,
    and that is contempt.</p><p pid="e667.2/7">Yesterday, the Attorney General as
    good as admitted it when he said:</p><p class="indent" pid="e667.2/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I
    wish that I could comply with the request of this House but if I did, I sincerely
    believe that it would not be in all of our interests.&#8221;</p><p pid="e667.2/9">And
    slightly later he said:</p><p class="indent" pid="e667.2/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;although
    the House says that I should disclose, I believe that the public interest compels
    me not to. I am sorry.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2018-12-03">3
    December</phrase> 2018; Vol. 650, c. 534 and 564.]</p><p pid="e667.2/11">That
    is a plea of mitigation; it is not a defence.</p><p pid="e667.2/12">I make three
    points about the Government&#8217;s position. First, as <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Jacob Rees-Mogg" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24926">the hon. Member
    for North East Somerset (Mr Rees-Mogg)</phrase> made clear yesterday, for the
    Attorney General to say that in his view it is not in the national interest is
    not good enough. The hon. Member for North East Somerset went on to say:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="e667.2/13" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;When the Government lose
    a vote, they must follow the will of this House under an Humble Address, according
    to all precedent. It is no longer a matter for the Government to judge; it has
    been decided by this House, which is a higher authority.&#8221;&#8212;[Official
    Report, <phrase class="date" code="2018-12-03">3 December</phrase> 2018; Vol.
    650, c. 563.]</p><p pid="e667.2/14">My second point is this: if the Attorney General
    feels so strongly about this matter that he is prepared now to put the Government
    in contempt of Parliament for refusing to comply with a binding order, why on
    earth did he not vote against the order in the first place, or anybody else on
    the Government Benches? That was not an oversight: the Government knew very well
    what was being asked for. The Attorney General must have known what was being
    debated and voted on. Yet it appears from answers given by the Attorney General
    yesterday that he was not asked before that vote for his view on the wisdom of
    not voting against the order, nor did he offer any advice, directly or indirectly.</p><p
    pid="e667.2/15">Again I quote the Attorney General:</p><p class="indent" pid="e667.2/16"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I had no discussions with the Chief Whip on this subject.
    None was sought.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2018-12-03">3
    December</phrase> 2018; Vol. 650, c. 569.]</p><p pid="e667.2/17">I do not doubt
    the Attorney General&#8217;s word for a minute, but really&#8212;before that vote
    nobody asked the Attorney General&#8217;s views on the consequence of not opposing
    the order?</p><p pid="e667.2/18">The truth is that the decision not to oppose
    the order was a political decision, taken by the Government because they feared
    they would lose the vote. They did not want the short-term humiliation of losing
    a vote, and the price of that was higher than voting against the order&#8212;and
    none of them did that. That is not the first time that has happened.</p>'

    a fair system that works for the entire UK, that attracts the brightest and the
    best from around the globe, and that allows access to the UK based on what someone
    has to offer, not where they come from. Leaving the EU means just that. For the
    first time in more than 40 years, we can deliver this by putting control over
    who comes to the UK firmly in our hands. Ending free movement is the first step,
    and that is what the Bill delivers.</p><p pid="b504.2/3">This is not about closing
    our doors&#8212;far from it. That is something I would never allow. We will continue
    to be an open, outward-looking and welcoming nation, because immigration has been
    invaluable to Britain. Immigrants to this country, such as my own parents, have
    been essential to the success of our society, culture and economy. They have powered&#8212;indeed,
    they have often created&#8212;many of our businesses. They have helped to deliver
    vital public services. Their experience has brought new perspectives and expertise,
    stimulating growth and making us the tolerant, outward-looking nation we are today.
    Far from slamming the door on immigration, the end of free movement will be a
    clear path to a fairer immigration system, helping us to welcome the most talented
    workers from any country while cutting net migration to sustainable levels.</p>'

    December</phrase> 2018, be revoked.</p><p pid="c938.0/3">These regulations are
    not labelled as no-deal preparatory regulations, but they are being pushed through
    via a statutory instrument in the middle of a series of about 70 Brexit-related
    statutory instruments relating to financial services, including one relating specifically
    to the operation of the securitisation regime. The matters raised by this instrument
    require more debate and scrutiny than they have been afforded. It is for that
    reason that we asked for this debate on the Floor of the House.</p><p pid="c938.0/4">As
    the Minister will be aware, the official Opposition also requested a debate on
    the Floor of the House about the transposition of the markets in financial instruments
    directive no-deal regulations via an SI. Those regulations were so complex that
    they required the production of a Keeling schedule, yet they were pushed through
    as a negative SI without any broader debate. This SI may be less wide-ranging
    than the other one but, like it, it is focused on the aspects of the financial
    system that precipitated and amplified the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p pid="c938.0/5">Securitisation
    refers to the pooling of different kinds of loans or debts and their repackaging
    into a single financial product that is sold to investors. The use of complex,
    opaque securitisations&#8212;particularly those linked to the US sub-prime housing
    market&#8212;has been viewed as a key element in transporting the negative impact
    of the credit crunch through the financial system into the heart of major financial
    institutions. It is therefore essential that any legislation proposing changes
    to the regulation of securities be carefully reviewed.</p><p pid="c938.0/6">The
    regulations have three main causes of concern. First, schedule 1 amends primary
    regulation&#8212;the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Schedule 1(8) nullifies
    the effect of section 399 of the Financial Services and Markets Act and disapplies
    section 402. Delegated legislation generally should not be used to amend primary
    legislation. Otherwise, it would allow the exercise of what lawyers and judges
    have disparagingly described as Henry VIII clauses. Put simply, primary legislation
    that has been drafted and reviewed by Parliament as a whole should not generally
    be revoked through statutory instruments. It might be argued that these regulations
    are part of a broader package of delegated legislation bringing in a new regime,
    but any regime of financial regulation is best set out in primary legislation.
    The Opposition made that point only two days ago in the debate on the transposition
    of so-called in-flight EU financial services legislation.</p><p pid="c938.0/7">The
    EU securitisation regulations are wide-ranging. For example, they impose a number
    of requirements on institutional investors to carry out due diligence before investing
    in a securitisation position. They relate not only to individual decisions about
    specified positions, but to the creation of new procedures for monitoring compliance
    and stress-testing. They also introduce numerous requirements for transparency
    for securitisation, requiring the originator, the sponsor and the securitisation  special
    purpose entity to designate one of their number to provide details of the securitisation,
    either to a repository or on a website. Finally, they provide preferential treatment
    to so-called simple, transparent and standardised securitisations, enabling them
    to be discounted for the purpose of allocating credit margins.</p><p pid="c938.0/8">A
    core element of STS securitisation is the retention by originators, sponsors and
    original lenders of a 5% stake in the securitisation, described colloquially as
    &#8220;skin in the game&#8221;. Those involved must also follow certain transparency
    and due diligence requirements. As such, although the regulation does to an extent
    consolidate existing legislation, it also significantly loosens the burden of
    capital retention for banks using STS securitisations compared with the previous
    situation. Some stakeholders felt that reigniting the use of securitisation through
    this legislation would help to promote liquidity and boost economic activity,
    given that it, in effect, allows higher levels of borrowing by the economic actors
    whose debt is repackaged in the securitisation. However, many others point to
    the potential dangers this poses for financial stability if unsafe, non-transparent
    and overly complex securitisations are allowed to fall within the STS bracket.
    This is especially the case given the reduced capital requirements to balance
    off the default risk from STS securitisations. I hardly need to remind this House
    of the problems caused to the sustainability of financial institutions and the
    subsequent calls made on the taxpayer due to insufficient margin being held by
    the banks against the risks they held.</p><p pid="c938.0/9">Secondly, these provisions
    amending primary legislation affect the criminal offences that are on the statute
    book. The legislation permits the use of sanctions for cases of negligence and
    intentional infringement, for example, fraudulent reporting of STS status. In
    addition, however, the provisions alter existing offences. The regulations appear
    to say that section 399 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which
    establishes an offences of misleading the Competition and Markets Authority, does
    not apply. In addition, paragraph 8 of schedule 1 prevents the FCA from instituting
    proceedings for money laundering and insider dealing. It is not clear why, on
    the basis of this statutory instrument alone, this needs to follow from the parent
    legislation. Why, if we are reading this complex statutory instrument right, does
    it abolish the offence of misleading the CMA and prevent the FCA from instituting
    proceedings for money laundering and insider dealing? What problem are these provisions
    addressing? Why are these changes being achieved through this piece of secondary
    legislation? We hope that we can receive some clarification on these points. If
    we cannot, these provisions would appear to be troubling. Because of the impact
    on people&#8217;s liberties and the overall balance of offences on the statute
    book, which surely should be as public and accessible as possible, criminal offences
    should not be altered by delegated legislation in this manner.</p><p pid="c938.0/10">Thirdly,
    and finally, these regulations transfer significant powers to the FCA to supervise
    compliance. It might be said that the FCA is the orthodox body to develop financial
    regulation and to ensure compliance with it, but there is a need for full debate
    about the allocation of responsibility for supervision and compliance. The original
    EU regulation provides no obligation for the FCA to be designated as the competent
    authority, so this is a  political choice. It is also not clear, on the basis
    of this statutory instrument, whether the FCA has sufficient resourcing and capacity
    to carry out these tasks. It is not optimal or desirable for these powers to be
    transferred via a statutory instrument.</p><p pid="c938.0/11">These powers are,
    of course, complicated by the interaction of this SI with the no-deal SI related
    to securitisation, which transfers the responsibility of the European Systemic
    Risk Board, for assessing and mitigating systemic risk, to the &#8220;competent
    authorities&#8221;. The latter are, as I understand it, here designated as the
    Prudential Regulation Authority, the FCA and the Bank, with systemic risk here
    identified as</p><p class="indent" pid="c938.0/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a
    material risk to the financial stability of a financial institution or to the
    financial system as a whole&#8221;.</p><p pid="c938.0/13">Under this approach,
    the FCA would also be able to permit re-securitisation for specified legitimate
    purposes, an important exception to the general ban imposed from this legislation
    on re-securitisation. The general ban prevents the underlying assets of a securitisation
    from being themselves already securitised assets&#8212;this is one of many activities
    that produced the highly complex and opaque securitisations linked to contagion
    during the financial crisis. As part of these regulations, the FCA would be responsible
    for ensuring that those engaged in a securitisation complied with the relevant
    transparency requirements. It is especially important that these kinds of regulatory
    developments receive scrutiny, given the content around elements of the securitisation
    package and, in particular, whether it is sufficiently stringent. What became
    known as &#8220;skin in the game&#8221; was set in the regulation at 5% of risk
    to be retained across each mode of risk retention, despite calls for a higher
    level from many quarters. Indeed, many actors within the EU questioned whether
    securitisation should be encouraged in the first place through the creation of
    the STS designation. Given that the resultant regulations were a balance between
    very polarised positions on this subject, it is essential that we properly scrutinise
    the transposition of these measures into UK law. For that reason, we have prayed
    against these measures being transferred purely through an SI process.</p>

    if you listened to some of the public discourse today&#8212;the teeth gnashing,
    the wailing, the portents of doom&#8212;you would not realise that in fact the
    British economy is doing rather well and that Britain is on the up. We have more
    people in work than ever before, the fastest wage rises in more than a decade
    and a record number of new start-ups. What is particularly interesting is that
    it is younger people in particular who are starting up those businesses. We have
    seen an 85% increase in the number of 18 to 24-year-olds setting up businesses
    in the last three years, so far from being a bunch of Starbucks-hating socialists,
    they are in fact more pro-low taxes and pro-enterprise than many older generations.</p><p
    pid="c257.1/5">We are also seeing investment flooding into Britain. We have got
    more investment in technology than other European countries, and the latest growth
    forecasts show that the UK economy is set to grow faster than Germany or Japan&#8217;s.
    The public finances have been brought back under control after years of profligacy,
    debt is falling as a proportion of GDP and we are reducing the deficit ahead of
    our plans. Why has this happened? Well, it has not happened by accident or because
    the Government say it should happen. It has happened because this country has
    a successful free enterprise economy, and the private sector has created millions
    of new jobs. The Government have created the conditions to enable this to happen
    and built the infrastructure to help those businesses to succeed. We have cut
    corporation tax and other taxes so that businesses are able to invest more in
    training and capital investment. We have made it easier for companies to take
    on staff through employment reforms. We have reformed our welfare system, introducing
    universal credit so that it always pays to work and to move up the jobs ladder.</p><p
    pid="c257.1/6">We are seeing the flourishing of Britain right across the country,
    with new businesses being established and succeeding. From Skyscanner in Edinburgh
    to WANdisco in Sheffield, Britain is leading the technology revolution. The sky
    is the limit for Britain, and there will be even more opportunities for growth
    and new trade around the world when we leave the EU.</p>

    English as I can, the two paragraphs of which the motion consists, neither of
    which is in any way complicated, but both of which have been drafted very carefully
    to ensure that the business proceeds smoothly and in good order as we go through
    what will no doubt be a quite complicated and highly contentious set of discussions
    about the substantive motions that have been tabled, from which you, Mr Speaker,
    have not yet selected, but that will no doubt be announced as a series of selections
    after we have completed the discussion and votes on the business of the House
    motion.</p><p pid="b333.1/30">Paragraph (1) is an effort to order today&#8217;s
    business in an orderly way, given that there may be a considerable number of substantive
    motions selected by Mr Speaker and that will therefore be debated, and, at 7 o&#8217;clock
    if the business of the House motion is accepted, to be voted on. I therefore draw
    the attention of hon. Members first to sub-paragraph (1)(i), which describes the
    method of voting. It is the intention that, to avoid taking too long voting on
    the substantive motions, we should retire into the two Lobbies. The Aye Lobby
    will be devoted to those whose names begin A to K, and the No Lobby will be devoted
    to those whose names begin L to Z. There will be, in those Lobbies, voting slips&#8212;I
    think of a different colour, but very similar in character to the deferred Division
    slips that we have used today and are quite used to using&#8212;which will be
    in a bundle and will  relate to all those motions on the Order Paper today that
    have been selected by Mr Speaker for vote at the end of the day.</p>

    revoke both EU regulation 2018/302 and the Geo-Blocking (Enforcement) Regulations
    2018 in the event of the UK exiting the EU without a withdrawal agreement. This
    recognises that in the event of a no-deal exit from the EU, there will be no way
    to enforce effectively the geo-blocking regulation on behalf of UK consumers.</p><p
    pid="b976.0/4">Geo-blocking is the term used to describe traders discriminating
    against customers on the basis of nationality or of the location of the customer.
    The EU&#8217;s geo-blocking regulation prohibits certain forms of geo-blocking,
    including through mandating access to all versions of a website in the EU, preventing
    discrimination between EU customers when distance shopping online or otherwise,
    and preventing discrimination in the payment terms accepted. This regulation came
    into force on <phrase class="date" code="2019-12-03">3 December</phrase> 2018.
    The geo-blocking regulation does not apply to copyrighted online content, such
    as movies, e-books and video games.</p><p pid="b976.0/5">The Geo-Blocking (Enforcement)
    Regulations 2018 enabled the domestic enforcement of the geo-blocking regulation.
    The regulations gave powers to certain regulators and acknowledged the right of
    customers to bring claims directly against infringing traders. These regulations
    came into force on the same day as the geo-blocking regulation. In the event of
    a no-deal exit from the EU, the geo-blocking regulation will be transposed directly
    into UK law, under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as retained EU law.
    The Geo-Blocking (Enforcement) Regulations 2018 will also continue to have effect
    after a no-deal exit, unless revoked.</p><p pid="b976.0/6">It is necessary to
    revoke both these pieces of legislation as it will not be possible to enforce
    effectively the geo-blocking regulation on behalf of UK customers after a no-deal
    exit from the EU. This is because EU regulators will no longer be obliged to bring
    action against businesses through EU mechanisms for cross-border co-operation;
    UK civil and commercial judgments would no longer be automatically enforced in

    cannot be enforced unilaterally by the UK across the EU in the event of a no deal,
    it is not possible to replicate the geo-blocking regulation&#8217;s benefits for
    UK consumers in domestic law. The provisions of the geo-blocking regulation do
    not apply to transactions occurring solely within one country. Therefore, there
    is no benefit to UK consumers in retaining a version of the geo-blocking regulation
    that applies only to the UK.</p>

    by saying that it is the feeling of both <phrase class="honfriend" name="Yvette
    Cooper" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10131">the right hon. Member for Normanton,
    Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> and me that we should accept
    amendment (a), which provides for the possibility of indicative votes on Monday,
    should that be necessary in the light of discussions between those on the Front
    Benches between now and then, which I strongly welcome.</p><p pid="b1058.1/54">This
    House has debated a number of measures in the past few weeks about the Order Paper
    and Standing Orders, and who controls them. I am sure that some of my right hon.
    and hon. Friends, some of whom have made learned and important speeches about
    the subject already, will wish to raise those issues again. Of course, I am happy
    to respond to any points made in the course of my remarks about that matter, but
    I do not intend to dwell on it all over again, because I have more or less said
    what I had to say about that subject. I just want to refer to the substance of
    the business of the House motion.</p><p pid="b1058.1/55">The first question that
    needs to be addressed is: why bother with this business of the House motion and,
    therefore, why bother at this point to consider the Bill that stands in the name
    of the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, of which I
    and others are backers, given that the Government have already said they are going
    to seek an extension, which, again, is an enormously welcome development? I say
    to my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench that it is not that I have
    any doubt that the Government will now wish to seek an extension and avoid the
    cliff edge of a no-deal exit on <phrase class="date" code="2019-04-12">12 April</phrase>,
    but rather that there is concern that there should be a transparent and orderly
    statutory process or framework within which the House has an opportunity to consider
    the length of the extension that is asked for and to provide the Prime Minister
    with backing for her request to the EU in an unequivocal and transparent way.
    That is the purpose of ensuring that we consider the Bill that follows this business
    of this House motion, and therefore the main purpose of the business of the House
    motion is simply to provide for the proceedings on that Bill.</p><p pid="b1058.1/56">The
    second question I wish to address is that of the speed with which we are considering
    the Bill. I would much prefer to have had considerably longer set out in   the
    business of the House motion for consideration of the implications of the Bill,
    because, as right hon. and hon. Members will see when it is debated, although
    the Bill is short, it is nevertheless significant and there are significant details
    associated with it. It would have been nice to have a considerable time in which
    to debate and consider it over a number of days, as is normal. Unfortunately,
    there is no point in legislating if that which we are legislating about has occurred
    before the time when the legislation would be relevant.</p>'

    the right thing in the national interest, to do the right thing whatever their
    different views on Brexit, and to do the right thing for their constituents. I
    hope that the very respectful and thoughtful tone of the debate that we had on
    the programme motion will be continued in this debate as well.</p><p pid="b1131.2/7">We
    have put forward this cross-party Bill to avert no deal on <phrase class="date"
    code="2019-04-12">12 April</phrase>. We have done so for fear of the damage that
    no deal would do to all our constituencies. We understand that the Cabinet Secretary
    and National Security Adviser to the Government, Sir Mark Sedwill, told the Cabinet
    yesterday that no deal would make our country &#8220;less safe&#8221;. The Cabinet
    has a responsibility to listen to that advice and I am extremely glad that it
    did. We understand, too, that the Cabinet was warned that food prices would go
    up by 10% in the event of no deal. Again, I am glad that it listened to that advice
    because that would have a huge impact on overstretched families across the country.</p>

    period ending on <phrase class="date" code="2019-06-30">30 June</phrase> 2019.</p><p
    pid="c232.3/3">I will endeavour to be brief in my remarks. I will, of course,
    take interventions, but please allow me to make three points by way of introduction.
    First, the Government did not want to be in this position. I do not say that in
    the spirit of seeking to attribute blame to people, but in a moment of solemn
    reflection it is important that we acknowledge where we find ourselves.</p><p
    pid="c232.3/4">It is of great disappointment to me and many others that this House
    has not felt able to approve the withdrawal agreement. The Prime Minister said
    last week that any plan for the future must include the withdrawal agreement.
    It is what we negotiated with the EU, and it remains the Government&#8217;s position
    that leaving with a deal is the best way for this country to leave the EU. Although
    I understand that certain right hon. and hon. Members have not found themselves
    in a position to support the withdrawal agreement, if we are to leave the EU in
    a smooth and orderly manner, we must find a way to find a plan for the way forward
    that includes it. Furthermore, the Government have already been clear that we
    are seeking an extension. As such, we continue to be of the view that the Bill
    passed last night was, with respect to its movers, unnecessary.</p><p pid="c232.3/5">Secondly,
    it is clear that the House is not willing to leave without a deal. Thirdly, nobody
    who respects the outcome of the referendum could wish the UK to participate in
    the European Parliament elections, nearly three years after our country voted
    to leave the institutions of the European Union. However, if the UK remains a
    member state on <phrase class="date" code="2019-05-23">23 May</phrase>, that is
    what it will be legally required to do. That is because the EU treaties provide
    that European Union citizens have the right to be represented in the European
    Parliament, and that the European Parliament needs to be properly constituted,
    with duly elected MEPs from all member states, for it to perform its functions.</p>

    the very poorest of communities&#8212;whether in inner cities like Manchester
    or my own city, Leicester, or in towns such as Blackpool or Burnley&#8212;will
    have a life expectancy that is around nine years lower than that of a child born
    at this very moment in some of the wealthiest communities, such as Chelsea, Westminster
    or east Dorset, and they will enjoy 18 fewer healthy years of life. Two babies
    born today could have years of difference in life expectancy and years of difference
    in healthy living, due entirely to the circumstances into which they are born.
    The child born in the very poorest of areas is more likely to leave school obese
    and almost 70% more likely to be admitted to A&amp;E. That child is less likely
    to receive measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations, more likely to take up smoking
    as a teenager, and more likely to need the help of specialist mental health services
    at some point.</p><p pid="b146.0/4">Of course, health inequalities have always
    existed, throughout the 71-year history of the national health service, but nine
    years of desperate, grinding austerity have brought us record food bank usage
    and in-work poverty, and seen child poverty increase to 4 million, with 123,000
    children today growing up homeless in temporary accommodation&#8212;a 70% increase
    since 2010. Some 4,700 of our fellow citizens sleep rough on our streets, an increase
    of 15%, and, tragically, nearly 600 of them die on our streets. There have also
    been savage cuts to public services, including social care, which have left 600,000
    elderly and vulnerable people without support. We have seen nine years of all
    that, and we should be shocked, because the advances in life expectancy that we
    all take for granted and that have steadily improved for 100 years are grinding
    to a halt.</p>'

  question: ''
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b662.0/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
    Third time.</p><p pid="b662.0/2">In 2015, the Government decided to accelerate
    the construction of the section of High Speed 2 between the west midlands and
    Crewe. This has become known as phase 2a. Our intention is to open this section
    of railway earlier than the rest of phase 2, to start bringing the benefits of
    the new railway to the north as soon as we can. Today, we can give an unequivocal
    statement that we are investing in our rail network, and in the midlands and north
    of England. This House has already given its backing to the building of phase
    1 of High Speed 2, paving the way for the first new railway north of London in
    more than 100 years. Our creaking rail network, which the Victorians took the
    bold step of building, has continued to serve us well, perhaps beyond the dreams
    of the visionaries who brought it to us. However, it is bursting at the seams,
    with more passengers than ever before, and certainly more than were ever envisioned.
    We have exhausted the options for just &#8220;improving&#8221; our existing west
    coast main line; 60% of the peak capacity from the &#163;9 billion west coast
    route modernisation project, completed as recently as 2008, had already been used
    by 2014. So we can have no more sticking plasters.</p><p pid="b662.0/3">I am delighted
    that the Bill for phase 1 received cross-party support. High Speed 2 was a 2017
    manifesto commitment of not just my party, but Her Majesty&#8217;s official Opposition.
    We all recognise that High Speed 2 is needed, not least because it will reduce
    congestion on our important rail transport arteries&#8212;it will also increase
    capacity. Adding an entirely new line between the west midlands and Crewe will
    increase capacity elsewhere on our existing rail network.</p>

    arises because of four facts. The first fact is that, over the past six weeks,
    the Government have not produced a single indication of any viable proposal to
    replace the backstop by any alternative likely to prove acceptable to the EU.
    The likelihood of the Government reaching a deal at the European Council meeting
    on 17 and <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-18">18 October</phrase> on the terms
    that the Government themselves have set is accordingly slight.</p><p pid="b81.2/68">The
    second fact is that this is the last week in which Parliament will have the ability
    to block a no-deal exit on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31 October</phrase>,
    because the Government are proroguing us until <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-14">14
    October</phrase>, and they have made it clear that they will fight in the courts
    any legislation proposed and passed to mandate an extension of the article 50
    process. There will not be time after <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-14">14
    October</phrase> for Parliament both to legislate and for that legislation to
    be enforced on a reluctant Government through the courts.</p><p pid="b81.2/69">The
    third fact is that, in the absence of a deal with the EU on the terms that the
    Government themselves have set and in the absence of an order from the Supreme
    Court that the Government should apply to extend the article 50 period, the Government
    will lead our country into a no-deal exit on <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-31">31
    October</phrase>. That has been made clear by the Prime Minister on repeated occasions.</p><p
    pid="b81.2/70">The fourth and final fact is that, instead of constituting a threat
    to the EU that will force them to capitulate and remove the backstop, the Government&#8217;s
    intention or willingness to lead the country into a no-deal exit is a threat to
    our country. The Prime Minister is much in the position of someone standing on
    one side of a canyon shouting to people on the other side of the canyon that if
    they do not do as he wishes, he will throw himself into the abyss. That is not
    a credible negotiating strategy, and it is also not a responsible strategy, given
    that the rest of us are to be dragged over the edge with the Prime Minister.</p>'

    The Bill is backed by Members who have very different views on how the matter
    of Brexit should be finally resolved, including Members who until very recently
    were senior members of the Cabinet. People could describe this as a somewhat unlikely
    alliance, but what unites us is a conviction that there is no mandate for no deal,
    and that the consequences for the economy and for our country would be highly
    damaging. Those supporting the Bill believe that no deal is not in the national

    debates to say this. It has been a privilege to serve in this House while you
    have been Speaker. Thank you.</p><p pid="c1162.5/4">I listened to the Prime Minister
    introducing the Queen&#8217;s Speech. What I always find most startling about
    the Prime Minister is his ability to create his own truth and, when confronted
    with any reality that contradicts his truth, to bluster his way through. I believe
    he believes that, with a combination of bluster and the occasional pretentious
    use of Latin, he can always avoid confronting reality or answering for it. So,
    if we can achieve anything in today&#8217;s debate, let us at least try to confront
    the reality of what some of our people face and assess whether the announcements
    in the Queen&#8217;s Speech in any way meet those challenges.</p><p pid="c1162.5/5">On
    the economy, the Prime Minister referred in his speech to &#8220;economic success&#8221;
    and &#8220;free market success&#8221;. He also said:</p><p class="indent" pid="c1162.5/6"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;in important respects this country is the greatest place
    to live and to be&#8212;the greatest place on earth.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report,
    <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-14">14 October</phrase> 2019; Vol. 666, c.
    19.]</p><p pid="c1162.5/7">I think many of us feel that way, but I just wish it
    was the same for everyone. For so many of our people, tragically, it is not at
    the moment. There is a multitude of statistics evidencing just how far the Prime
    Minister is out of touch and how he appears to have no understanding of what our
    people have gone through over nearly a decade. Let me start with three stark  examples
    of what the austerity the Conservative party has inflicted on our people has meant
    and continues to mean, and which I deeply regret were not addressed in the Queen&#8217;s
    Speech.</p><p pid="c1162.5/8">First, on infant mortality and child poverty, earlier
    this month, the British Medical Journal published a research project into infant
    mortality. Declines in infant mortality have been reversed for the first time
    in 100 years. The research found that, between 2014 and 2017, there were 570 excess
    infant deaths. The research concluded that 172 of those infant deaths were associated
    with the increase in child poverty. Out there, there are nearly 200 families who
    are grieving as a result of the Government&#8217;s austerity policies. There is
    nothing in the Queen&#8217;s Speech&#8212;nothing&#8212;that will tackle the poverty
    affecting 14 million of our people, and nothing that will tackle the poverty that
    4.5 million of our children are being brought up in, or help the 125,000 children
    who are forced to live in temporary accommodation. There is nothing to address
    the &#163;3 billion funding gap local councils face in trying to provide the services
    needed to support those very families. I will not forget, and many Labour Members
    will not forget, that this is a Government who have closed over 500 Sure Start
    centres, the very institutions we founded to support those families and to prevent
    infant mortality and morbidity on the scale we have seen.</p><p pid="c1162.5/9">Let
    me take the second example of what the Tories have done to our people. Earlier
    this month, the Office for National Statistics reported a record number of deaths
    of homeless people in England and Wales in 2018. Last year, 726 homeless people
    died. That represents the highest year-to-year increase since data was first collected.
    The Government have cut &#163;1 billion from support to the homeless since 2010,
    so it is hardly surprising that rough sleeping has risen by almost 165%. In London,
    rough sleeping has more than tripled since 2010. Again, there is nothing&#8212;nothing&#8212;in
    the Queen&#8217;s Speech to tackle the scourge of homelessness.</p><p pid="c1162.5/10">My
    third example is the distance between what the Government claim and what employment
    and wages are like in this country. The Prime Minister claimed that</p><p class="indent"
    pid="c1162.5/11" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;we have unemployment at its lowest
    level since 1974&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="2019-10-14">14
    October</phrase> 2019; Vol. 666, c. 22.]</p><p pid="c1162.5/12">The reality is
    this: more than 3 million people are missing from the unemployment rate because
    they report themselves as &#8220;economically inactive,&#8221; we have over 2.5
    million people counted as employed even though they work fewer than 15 hours a
    week and there are 3.7 million people in insecure work.</p>'

    the overriding view that will come to be associated with this Government may well

    pid="e38.5/5">The Government&#8217;s programme in the Queen&#8217;s Speech fails

    austerity is baked into the Government&#8217;s economic policies, which fail to
    tackle insecure work, to end in-work poverty and to introduce a real living wage.
    Worst of all, the Queen&#8217;s Speech fails to address the brutal hardship caused
    by universal credit, introduced by this Government. We face twin emergencies:
    first, a climate emergency, an existential threat to our planet that, as we have
    seen only too well in Australia and Indonesia, is rapidly spiralling beyond control;
    and, secondly, in this country, a social emergency  resulting from a decade of
    harsh austerity and decline. Last year, the House resolved that we faced a climate
    emergency. We should also resolve that we face a social emergency.</p>'

    I am proud, therefore, of the Labour party&#8217;s pledge to put tackling the
    climate crisis at the heart of our transport and wider economic policy. It is
    both right and necessary, not least because since 2010 the transport policies

    it was written on. There have been vast cuts in bus funding and services; huge
    cuts in rail electrification programmes; support for airport expansion; and major
    road expansion programmes. Those actions are a matter of fact and public record.
    They are not the actions of a Government who are serious about tackling the climate
    crisis; they are the actions of a Government without a relevant transport policy.</p>

    and serious debate on migration and to support the incredibly reasonable and considered
    policy proposals recently published by the Scottish Government&#8212;proposals
    that would ensure migration policy worked for every part of the UK but could also
    be tailored to reflect Scotland&#8217;s particular needs and circumstances. Indeed,
    those two features go together, for it is only by making sure the system is tailored
    to the different parts of the UK that we actually ensure that it can work for
    all the different parts of the UK.</p><p pid="e771.4/4">From the outset, it is
    important to emphasise that these proposals have been widely consulted upon and
    developed collaboratively. The report flags up support for a tailored system from
    organisations such as the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland, the Scottish
    Council for Development and Industry, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, the
    Law Society of Scotland, the David Hume Institute and the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
    Many more names could be added to the list, from the all-party group on social
    integration to think-tanks such as the Institute for Public Policy Research. A
    range of academic reports have set out options for differentiation, including
    Dr Christina Boswell and Dr Sarah Kyambi at the University of Edinburgh and Dr
    Eve Hepburn for the Scottish Parliament. Lessons from international examples have
    been learned, from, among others, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Switzerland.</p><p
    pid="e771.4/5">During the Brexit referendum campaign, we were told by the now
    Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on the matter of future immigration numbers:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="e771.4/6" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;It would be for Scotland
    to decide because under the proposals that we have put forward we believe that
    a points based immigration policy&#8230;would be the right approach.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="e771.4/7">He went on to say that the head of the Leave campaign in Scotland
    had written to the First Minister explaining how Scotland</p><p class="indent"

    simple proposal put forward by the Scottish Government is for an additional visa
    route for people to come to live and work in Scotland. Learning, in particular,
    from Canada&#8217;s provincial nominee programme, it would ideally be for Scottish
    Ministers to set out criteria and rules for selecting who could get one of those
    visas. The Scottish Government would then accept and reject applications against
    those criteria. The application would then transfer to the Home Office, not for
    reassessing the merits of the application, but to verify identity, check immigration
    history and satisfy security requirements. The visa granted would include a requirement
    that the visa holder live in Scotland for its duration. There would ideally be
    routes to settlement after that, probably at the five-year mark. It is acknowledged
    that a range of different models would be possible. The details and the numbers
    involved would be subject to negotiation.</p>'

    social and climate emergencies that our country now faces. And yes, there is a
    social emergency in many of our communities. Yesterday, my hon. Friend <phrase
    class="honfriend" name="Jon Ashworth" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25120">the
    Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)</phrase>, the shadow Health Secretary,
    exposed the appalling levels of health inequality across the regions of our country.
    Today, the Marmot report shows what he described as the &#8220;shocking&#8221;
    results of 10 years of austerity: life expectancy has stalled for the first time
    in more than 100 years, and has even been reversed for the most deprived within
    our community, women in particular.</p><p pid="d185.2/4">Yesterday, <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Andrew Gwynne" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11531">the hon. Member
    for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State
    for Communities and Local Government revealed the scandalous impact of cuts to
    local councils&#8212;for example, the impact they have had on the services desperately
    needed to keep our children safe. This afternoon, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Barbara Keeley" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11943">the Member for
    Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>, the shadow Minister for mental
    health and social care, will describe the immense suffering and distress caused
    by the cuts in social care imposed by this Government. Members will remember the
    report only last year, reporting that 87 people died each day before actually
    receiving the care they needed.</p><p pid="d185.2/5">At present, we have a Government
    who, on this evidence, have proved to be incapable of providing care for our people,
    of housing our people, of feeding them or of providing the work that will lift
    them and their families out of poverty. There is a lot of hyped-up talk about
    the big expenditure numbers that might be associated with the coming Budget. What
    we are interested in is outcomes, and the impact on the wellbeing of our people.
    These will be the key tests of the forthcoming Budget. Will it really end austerity?
    Will it really reverse the decade of austerity cuts that have been imposed on
    our community by this Government? Will it ensure that our people are properly
    cared for, properly housed, properly fed and lifted out of poverty? Alongside
    all of this, in a week when we have seen the Prime Minister&#8217;s failure to
    respond to the flooding that has damaged so many of our people&#8217;s lives,
    the overriding test is: will this Budget tackle the existential threat of climate
    change?</p><p pid="d185.2/6">It is interesting that, contrary to virtually all
    the advice from mainstream economists 10 years ago, the newly elected Conservative
    Government took the political decision to impose austerity cuts on our community.
    As we have repeatedly said, it was a political choice, not an economic necessity.
    The alternative was to ensure that we had a fair taxation system to fund our social
    infra- structure, and that we borrowed to invest in our physical infrastructure
    to grow our way out of recession. The reality is rather that the neo-liberal ideologues
    simply could not let the economic crisis go to waste. They seized the opportunity
    to launch their experiment to downsize the role of the state through cuts, outsourcing
    and privatisation. This was linked to ever more restrictions to reduce the effectiveness
    of trade unions to represent their members and to shift the balance of power between
    capital and labour in the workplace.</p><p pid="d185.2/7">The result has been
    that virtually every area of our public services is in crisis, with the slowest
    growth in wages in 200 years, 8 million of our people in working households in
    poverty and over 4 million of our children in poverty. The UN rapporteur has described
    levels of destitution in our country and the treatment of disabled people as an
    abuse of human rights. The Government&#8217;s alibi for austerity was the global
    financial crisis, even though Government spending was never a cause of that crash.
    Now, 12 years on, the Government no longer have that fake alibi for the cuts.
    It is clear the Tories do not just want to shrink public services and cut public
    sector jobs in the short term; they want to downsize our public services for good&#8212;as
    the Institute for Fiscal Studies has said, baking austerity into Government.</p><p
    pid="d185.2/8">All this suffering, all this hardship, all this holding back the
    potential of a near-generation of our people would have been rendered completely
    unnecessary if we had had a fair taxation system and had invested in our economy.
    A fair taxation system starts with ensuring that people and corporations pay their
    taxes. That patently is not the case at the moment. There is much talk about levelling
    up; well, let us start with levelling up the rules of taxation and the amount
    many of the rich and the corporations pay in taxes.</p>'

    chance to debate social care today: it is two weeks ahead of the Budget and there
    is the ever present hope that the Government will announce much-needed social
    care reform. This reform is long overdue. After nearly a decade of cuts, our social
    care system is on its knees. For the people who rely on social care and for their
    families, the reality is that things have got much worse under successive Conservative
    Governments. Every day last year, 2,000 older people who had approached their
    local authority for help with social care were turned down. The result is that
    there are currently 1.5 million older people who are not getting the support they
    need&#8212;each one struggling to cope with basic everyday tasks. This can mean
    people left trapped in bed all day or going unwashed all week, because family
    carers can visit them only on the weekends, and those are the people who are fortunate
    enough to have help from unpaid carers. Around half the 1.5 million get no help
    at all&#8212;not even from family and friends. They cope as best they can until
    they end up in hospital, and then they cannot get out of hospital because they
    can only be discharged safely once a social care package is set up, with the local
    authorities struggling to find the funding for it.</p><p pid="d242.2/4">Another
    failure in our social care system is where people are held in entirely inappropriate
    institutions because the local authority cannot fund the care they need to keep
    them safe in the community. There are 2,200 autistic people and people with learning
    disabilities who continue to be detained on in-patient wards. This is one of the
    most egregious failures of our social care system. They should be able to live
    in their own homes with a support package, but the funding is not there. For eight
    years the Government have been promising to end this scandal, but they have failed
    to do so.</p>'

    outstanding NHS.</p><p pid="a398.3/4">Since publishing the details of the new
    points-based system in February, our world has undoubtedly changed, but what has
    not changed is the Government&#8217;s unwavering support for our NHS and its incredible
    professional staff. They are the very best of Britain. That is why we are introducing
    a new fast-track NHS visa, to prioritise the qualified staff needed to provide
    high-quality and compassionate professional care. During these exceptional times,
    it is right that policies that affect our NHS workers are kept under review, including
    the immigration health surcharge. That is why I recently announced a free automatic
    one-year visa extension for those with six months or less left to stay on their
    visas. Our EU settlement scheme enables EU citizens who made our country their
    home to continue to build their lives here, including those working in the NHS.</p><p
    pid="a398.3/5">As Britain fight back against coronavirus, controlling the virus
    to save lives remains the Government&#8217;s top priority, but it is also our
    duty to continue to serve the  public by delivering on the people&#8217;s priorities
    so that when these darker days are behind us, we can focus on building a brighter
    future&#8212;a brighter future for people in cities, towns and villages across
    all four nations&#8212;and, as we have promised, on levelling up right across
    the country, especially in those areas that have been left behind in economic
    renewal in the past and communities that placed their trust in us back in December
    last year.</p><p pid="a398.3/6">It is almost four years since the British people
    voted for independence from the European Union. This Government have already delivered
    that sovereignty, and we have been clear that there will be no extension to the
    transition period with the EU. We promised the British people that we would end
    free movement, take back control of our borders and restore trust in the immigration
    system. This Bill delivers on that.</p><p pid="a398.3/7">The story of immigration
    in the UK is woven into our national fabric. It is at the core of our national
    character and has defined many traditions and characteristics of our country.
    It is a testament to British society that, notwithstanding the past struggles
    of race, ethnicity and class, today in this very House so many descendants of
    migrants are now representing every region of the United Kingdom. Equally, our
    national fabric continues to be enriched by EU citizens who have made the UK their
    home. From day one, despite scaremongering from those in the Labour party, we
    have been clear: we say to EU citizens in the UK&#8212;to all of them&#8212;&#8220;We
    want you to stay&#8221;.</p><p pid="a398.3/8">Our successful EU settlement scheme
    has now seen over 3.5 million applications, with over 1.3 million concluded. This
    is a fantastic example of a digital and data-led project delivering real results,
    despite many of those who have sought deliberately to campaign against the scheme
    and undermine public trust and confidence in protecting the rights of EU citizens
    in the UK.</p><p pid="a398.3/9">This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to
    reform our immigration system, and we are determined to get it right. Through
    our extensive engagement programme, we have consulted the British people, business
    leaders, employers, civic groups, local government, academia and specialist organisations
    such as those working with vulnerable migrants. Our proposal to lift the cap on
    skilled workers has been supported by the CBI. The decision to widen the threshold
    for skilled workers has been welcomed by the Construction Industry Training Board,
    and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry has spoken favourably about the
    plans for the salary threshold.</p><p pid="a398.3/10">This responsive, people&#8217;s
    Government have listened to the evidence and designed an immigration system that
    meets the needs of our businesses, our economy and our country. To ensure that
    it works from the start, our extensive engagement programme continues. We are
    working with employers to make it a success for them. We are supporting them every
    step of the way to ensure that their economic needs and business needs are supported,
    so people know that global Britain is open for business. The Government will work
    with employers to develop a UK-wide labour market strategy, enabling businesses
    to move away from their reliance on the immigration system as an alternative to
    investing in the domestic labour market, and encouraging employers to invest in
    people, their skills and development, leading to an economy that is fit for the
    future, with higher productivity and wider investment in technology and skills.</p><p
    pid="a398.3/11">The current crisis has shone a light on how we value those who
    provide compassionate care across health and social care. The Government&#8217;s
    long-term solution for social care is focused on investing in those who deliver
    that compassionate and high-quality care. An additional &#163;1.5 billion has
    already been allocated for adult and children&#8217;s social care in this financial
    year, and the Government are working with the sector on a plan for the long-term
    recruitment, investment and training of those who are dedicating their careers
    to care. As the Migration Advisory Committee identified in its own report published
    earlier this year, the immigration system is not the sole solution to the employment
    issues in the social care sector.</p><p pid="a398.3/12">I will now set out for
    hon. Members exactly what this Bill does. First and foremost, the purpose of this
    Bill is to end free movement. From <phrase class="date" code="2020-01-01">1 January</phrase>
    2021, all EU and non-EU citizens will be treated equally. The Bill repeals all
    EU immigration legislation retained under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
    2018, as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020. This means
    that European economic area citizens, including EU and European Free Trade Association
    citizens, and their family members will become subject to UK immigration law,
    and they will require the same permission to enter and remain in this country
    as people from the rest of the world&#8212;levelling the playing field and giving
    everybody the same opportunity to come to the UK regardless of which countries
    they come from.</p><p pid="a398.3/13">A great deal has changed over the last four
    years, but the one thing that has remained stable is the Labour party&#8217;s
    refusal to support the end of free movement. The leader may have changed, but
    the dogged determination to deny the will of the people has not. From Bolsover
    to Blyth Valley, Darlington to Stoke-on-Trent South, and beyond, the message to
    this House from the British people at the ballot box was clear: they voted to
    end free movement and for a firmer and fairer points-based immigration system,
    with control over who comes into our country based on the skills they have to
    offer, not where they come from.</p><p pid="a398.3/14">We are enormously proud
    of our deep and historical ties with Ireland, and of the contribution Irish citizens
    have made to the UK over many years, which is why the Bill will protect the rights
    of Irish citizens. The long-standing arrangements between our countries ensure
    that Irish citizens benefit from specific rights in the UK&#8212;the same rights
    that British citizens enjoy in Ireland&#8212;including the right to work, to study,
    to access healthcare and social security benefits, and to vote. The Bill makes
    it clear that once free movement ends, Irish citizens will continue to be able
    to come to the UK to live and work as they do now, regardless of where they have
    travelled from. There will remain limited exceptions, where Irish citizens are
    subject to deportation orders, exclusion decisions or international travel bans.
    But the wider rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in the UK that flow from the common
    travel area arrangements will remain, as was reaffirmed in the memorandum of understanding
    signed by the UK and Ireland last year. Both Governments are committed to preserving
    the unique status and special rights in each other&#8217;s countries enjoyed for
    over 100 years.</p><p pid="a398.3/15">Thirdly, the Bill makes an important power
    to ensure UK legislation remains coherent once free movement ends. The power permits
    amendments to primary and secondary legislation that become necessary after the  end
    of free movement, which means we can align our treatment of EEA and non-EEA citizens
    and deliver a system in which everyone is treated equally.</p><p pid="a398.3/16">Finally,
    the Bill will enable us to make any necessary changes to our social security system
    as we align access to benefits for EEA and non-EEA citizens. It will also contain
    powers to allow the Government or a devolved authority to amend the retained EU
    social security co-ordination rules from the end of the transition period. We
    have been clear that any future arrangements on social security must respect Britain&#8217;s
    autonomy in setting its own rules. Social security co-ordination arrangements
    will change&#8212;for example, the right to export child benefits will end, as
    was announced in the Budget. The Bill will enable us to deliver on this commitment.</p><p
    pid="a398.3/17">The Bill is integral to our plans to simplify and reform the immigration
    system. The current system has expanded over decades. It has become inefficient
    and difficult to navigate for those who want to come to this country. We are seizing
    this opportunity to change the entire system, end to end, for the better, with
    simple, clear and transparent routes, which is why I welcome the Law Commission&#8217;s
    recent report on simplifying the immigration rules, and why I have accepted many
    of its recommendations. Cutting through the complexity and streamlining processes
    will be at the heart of the new immigration system, with new, clear, consistent
    and accessible rules. Of equal importance will be our ability to act against those
    who break our rules, including through illegal migration, and our ability to remove
    those who abuse our hospitality by committing crime.</p><p pid="a398.3/18">There
    are many across the House who care passionately about immigration issues, from
    <phrase class="honfriend" name="David Lammy" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10678">the
    right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)</phrase>, who has strived to get justice
    for the Windrush generation, wronged by successive Governments, to <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Alison Thewliss" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25327">the hon. Member
    for Glasgow Central (Alison Thewliss)</phrase>, who speaks passionately about
    immigration and asylum, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Alberto
    Costa" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25413">the Member for South Leicestershire
    (Alberto Costa)</phrase>, who regularly raises the issue of citizenship and the
    rights of EU nationals, as he did this weekend with me. These are vital issues
    and they have all had their time on the Floor of this House, but all these issues
    fall outside the simple Bill before us today.</p><p pid="a398.3/19">The Bill is
    a simple one that delivers on the promise we made to the British people. It ends
    free movement. It takes back control of our borders. It gives the Government the
    powers needed to deliver an immigration system that is firm, fair and fit for
    the future: the points-based system the public voted for; a system that will support
    our economic recovery by prioritising jobs for people here in the UK while continuing
    to attract the brightest and best in terms of global talent; a system that will
    make it cheaper, easier and quicker for global medical professionals to work in
    our brilliant NHS; and, as we come through coronavirus, a system that will send
    a message to the world that global Britain is once again open for business. I
    commend the Bill to the House.</p>'

    constituencies declines to give a Second Reading to the Parliamentary Constituencies
    Bill because the Bill would disproportionately and undemocratically concentrate
    power over constituency sizes and boundaries in the hands of the executive, because

    being based on an incomplete register owing to the impact of the covid-19 pandemic
    on the preparation of electoral registers.&#8221;</p><p pid="d770.0/3">Every single
    one of us in the House today represents a constituency that has been drawn up
    based on the electorate data of nearly two decades ago. Twenty years ago, our
    country and our communities looked very different. Some of our communities have
    grown and others have seen population decline. Indeed, in that time, 2 million
    more electors have come on to the electoral roll and it is time we counted them
    when it comes to the constituencies we represent.</p><p pid="d770.0/4">We hope
    that the review can be completed before the next general election and that there
    will be no further delay. After two shelved boundary reviews, the public will
    not want more taxpayers&#8217; money to be wasted on a review that does not see
    the light of day. We need a boundary review, and the Opposition stand ready to
    work with the Government on that if it is fair and the rules are not inserted
    or omitted on the basis of any perceived political advantage for any party.</p><p
    pid="d770.0/5">The Bill must proceed with the aim of delivering a fair and democratic
    review. We want the new boundaries to reflect the country as it is today and ensure
    that all communities get fair representation. Those boundaries must also take
    into consideration local ties and identities.</p><p pid="d770.0/6">I welcome the
    Government&#8217;s decision to reverse their previous position of reducing the
    number of MPs to 600. As we have left the European Union and the work of the UK&#8217;s
    73 MEPs falls to this House, it would have piled a heavier workload on to fewer
    shoulders. More importantly, it would have handed further power to the Executive,
    because reducing the number of MPs while refusing to cut the size of the Government
    payroll would create a dangerous level of Executive dominance at the expense of
    Parliament and our democracy.</p><p pid="d770.0/7">Welcoming the return to proposing
    650 MPs brings me to the last two wasted reviews on the 600 figure. With two abandoned
    reviews, we are in a farcical situation with boundaries. While Tory Ministers
    argued with their Back Benchers, public resources flooded down the drain. Millions
    of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money has been wasted. The unfinished 2013 review
    cost British taxpayers &#163;7 million. It wasted the time and expertise of the
    boundary commissioners in working towards a target that was destined to be scrapped,
    and the 2018 review was equally wasteful. In a written question, the Government
    estimated the cost at &#163;8 million. The Government have not provided a recent
    figure on that, but I have given the Minister the opportunity to do so by tabling
    a written parliamentary question asking just that.</p><p pid="d770.0/8">However,
    one of the biggest concerns that the Opposition has about the Bill is the Government&#8217;s
    decision to end parliamentary oversight of the process. It is yet another  attempt
    to diminish scrutiny over executive power. Parliamentary oversight is fundamental
    to the democratic passing of a Bill, and this Bill is no different. The Minister
    says that it is to stop MPs blocking new boundaries, but in the last Parliament
    it was her Government who never tabled that review for a vote, so we will never
    know the outcome of a vote that never took place.</p><p pid="d770.0/9">The process
    of needing MPs to vote for the final report from the commission is an important
    safety net, because without it we would now have just 600 MPs here today. When
    the Government wanted to go back to 650, it was that safety net that allowed them
    to do so and make that happen, but removing parliamentary scrutiny is worrying
    for the future integrity of our democracy. This loophole allows a power grab,
    with no parliamentary backstop to limit the dominance of the Executive. The Government
    have not shown any regard for the primacy of Parliament. Indeed, the unlawful
    prorogation of Parliament is a case in point.</p><p pid="d770.0/10">I note the
    remarks that the Minister made about the enumeration date in the Bill of December
    2020. I am glad that she is looking at this, and I look forward to her update
    to the House, because after 20 years of delay, the boundaries must reflect the
    electorate with the best possible accuracy. I urge her to consider ditching the
    <phrase class="date" code="2020-12-01">1 December</phrase> 2020 register in light
    of the unprecedented covid-19 crisis that we are currently living through. Our
    councils are working flat out to support our communities at the present time,
    and to ask them to undertake an annual canvass at a time of social distancing
    when they have stretched capacity risks that register being patchy at best. So
    I welcome the Minister&#8217;s remarks and put on record my thanks for the hard
    work that all our councils are doing in supporting some of our most vulnerable
    residents at this time.</p>

  question: Question put, That the clause be added to the Bill.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="e900.0/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
    Third time.</p><p pid="e900.0/2">I thank hon. and right hon. Members from all
    parts of the House for their careful scrutiny of the Bill throughout its passage.
    I am deeply grateful to all those who have contributed to the debate in Committee
    today and on Second Reading last week. I acknowledge that there have been some
    dissenting voices on reform of the law&#8212;first, as a matter of principle&#8212;and
    differing opinions as to precisely how to reform it, but I am happy to make  it
    clear that those contributions have been of no less value than those that have
    supported the purpose of the Bill and its approach to reform. We have been fortunate
    to have these debates enriched by the variety of viewpoints expressed.</p><p pid="e900.0/3">During
    the passage of the Bill, Members have rightly raised questions about its potential
    impact on families, but I believe that it actually has marriage and families at
    its heart. It is for that reason that I believe so strongly in the measures contained
    within it. While no one wants marriages to break down, the proposals in the Bill
    are based on the very sad reality that some do. When they do, the law should seek
    to reduce conflict and to create the best opportunity for the parties to agree
    future arrangements. It is not for the law to try to keep a couple in a loveless
    marriage, and nor can the law in practice adjudicate on who was to blame for its
    breakdown. That is an intensely private and personal matter between the couple
    themselves.</p><p pid="e900.0/4">This is a measured Bill that will bring much-needed
    reform. It is reform that many of its supporters believe is long overdue. It will
    allow parties to move forwards, not backwards, and it will deliver a legal process
    that reduces conflict and its impact on children while safeguarding the importance
    of marriage.</p><p pid="e900.0/5">During its passage through both Houses, the
    Government have listened with interest and care to the issues raised. In the other
    place, there was debate concerning the law on financial provision on divorce and
    concerns that it, too, can drive conflict. Some Members in this place have also
    made that important point. My noble and learned Friend Lord Keen gave assurances
    that the Government would conduct a review of that area of law, which has remained
    unchanged for nearly 50 years. That is a substantial undertaking where we will
    need to be led by the evidence, which is yet to be gathered, and it is thus not
    a matter for this Bill.</p><p pid="e900.0/6">We have also listened to concerns
    about the start point of the new 20-week minimum period prior to the conditional
    order of divorce, and we have given an undertaking that we will work with the
    Family Procedure Rule Committee to consider how court rules may provide for a
    requirement on applicants to serve notice within a specified period. We listened
    to concerns from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee about two
    delegated powers in the Bill that would allow the legal minimum periods for divorce
    orders and dissolution orders to be amended. Those powers will now be subject
    to the enhanced scrutiny procedure via the affirmative mechanism.</p><p pid="e900.0/7">Beyond
    the Bill, many detailed changes will be needed to divorce procedure, court IT
    systems, online information and guidance. We will take the opportunity to look
    at ways to improve signposting to the services that can help couples when facing
    the prospect of a divorce and during the subsequent legal process. We recognise
    the value of relationship support and mediation services, which can play a vital
    role in addressing relationship breakdown. The Chancellor announced &#163;2.5
    million to fund research into how best to integrate family services, including
    the emerging family hub model. The Department for Education will ensure that strengthening
    relationship support is part of that research programme, so that vital work is
    completed in that area.</p><p pid="e900.0/8">It is important to take a moment
    to focus on what the Bill does not do. I believe that that is necessary because
    I have been concerned about certain misconceptions  that have arisen about it.
    First, it is not a quickie divorce Bill&#8212;quite the contrary. It will, for
    the first time, provide a new 20-week minimum period between the start of proceedings
    and the conditional order. Secondly, the Bill does not undermine marriage. It
    is a Bill to reform the legal process for divorce once the sad stage of irretrievable
    breakdown has already been reached.</p><p pid="e900.0/9">Thirdly, the Bill does
    not in any way undermine the hugely valuable and vital mediation, counselling
    and relationship support services that can and do assist reconciliation. Finally,
    the Bill definitely does not come at the wrong time. Its current stage is the
    culmination of a lengthy process.</p>

    demands in this Bill are not new, and although its title includes the word &#8220;abortion&#8221;,
    the termination of pregnancy is not at issue here&#8212;not the number of weeks,
    or anything of that nature. This is about women being able to present themselves
    for legal healthcare free from intimidation.</p><p pid="e1314.2/4">Many Members
    with a clinic within their boundary will know the issue at stake. In 2017, I and
    113 cross-party colleagues wrote to the then Home Secretary Amber Rudd, which
    resulted in her commissioning a review. Alas, by the time it reported back, her
    successor recognised the problem but deemed it was not serious enough to address.
    Yet any harassment is surely wrong and since then things have worsened. Pre-lockdown,
    there were scenes of scores of protesters obstructing the entrance to the BPAS
    Finsbury Park clinic. That made national news. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Catherine West" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25328">the Member for
    Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West)</phrase> called on the Government to bring
    forward legislation to protect women from Cardiff to Eastbourne and Doncaster&#8212;even
    my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has this menace on his patch.</p><p
    pid="e1314.2/5">Lockdown provided some respite, but they are at it again. It took
    over three decades of protests outside the Marie Stopes clinic in Ealing until
    the exasperated council in 2018 introduced Britain&#8217;s first buffer zone&#8212;a
    public spaces protection order, a local authority byelaw&#8212;so that women could
    access healthcare services in confidence and dignity, with their journey down
    the street and up the path into the clinic unimpeded by anti-abortion or even
    pro-choice campaigners after having probably made the most difficult decision
    of their lives.</p><p pid="e1314.2/6">But with the covid-19 crisis preoccupying
    local authorities&#8212;although the protesters do not seem deterred by it&#8212;councils
    have enough on their plate without having to find the time and resources for the
    onerous process necessary for a PSPO. While a PSPO is an infinite improvement
    on what was there before, it is cumbersome and only temporary. Ours ends next
    year, and it took a six-figure sum to gather evidence and redeploy a senior team
    of officers from elsewhere for six months, and to pay for the subsequent signage
    and the legal fees from the inevitable challenges from the well-endowed people
    on the other side.</p><p pid="e1314.2/7">I have been aware of Ealing protests
    since the &#8217;90s, which included disturbing 2D and 3D foetus images lining
    the road. When I became a parent and had to walk my own past there, I shuddered
    more. As an MP, I received representations from constituents from neighbouring
    houses, with people saying that they there were not sure whether to comfort the
    women in distress. Worse still was the anguish felt by women clinic users. They
    were usually young and about to go through a challenging process, sometimes after
    rape or a fatal foetal abnormality. The last thing they needed in that situation
    was to be met by lifelike, medically inaccurate  foetus dolls and graphic images,
    handed misleading literature on the way in, or called &#8220;mum&#8221; and told
    they would go to hell. I held a meeting at the clinic, and we only got in because
    it was raining that day and the protesters were put off by the precipitation.
    The clinic keeps an incident log, and staff reported being hounded themselves,
    and told me about women either missing appointments or turning up in tears due
    to groups congregating outside, thus causing potential physical and emotional
    harm to themselves. There was a record number of submissions to the PSPO consultation,
    including reports of clinic users being shouted at, having their arms grabbed,
    and being filmed on camera phones. While pro-life supporters claim that handing
    out leaflets and kneeling with rosary beads is not harassment or intimidation,
    nor needs police intervention, as Justice Turner said when upholding the Ealing
    decision at the High Court, it is &#8220;uninvited attention&#8221; when women
    are &#8220;vulnerable and sensitive&#8221;.</p><p pid="e1314.2/8">Ealing&#8217;s
    chief superintendent told me that the police would prefer national protections
    as this order is about to run out and the whole onerous process must start again.
    Policing has been made a lot better now, with officers freed up to fight crime,
    rather than keeping rival groups apart at the gate since the emergence of the
    pro-choice advocacy group, Sister Supporter.</p><p pid="e1314.2/9">In reality,
    however, only one side protests not in the traditional sense by targeting legislators
    like us to change decisions, but by targeting individual women on their way to
    make this agonising decision that they have often made as a forced choice, and
    with judgments on their morality cast all over them. The High Court, the Court
    of Appeal and Supreme Court have all affirmed the Ealing decision, with my brilliant
    barrister constituent, Kuljit Bhogal, defending each time, but the cash-strapped
    council and our leader Julian Bell now fear further expense because the next stop
    is going to be the European Court of Human Rights, at a time when every penny
    from the public purse counts.</p><p pid="e1314.2/10">Life is all about weighing
    up competing interests, and freedom of thought, of conscience, of expression and
    of assembly are often cited, but clinic users also have a right to privacy. Pregnancy
    is something we tend to keep private until it shows: I definitely did&#8212;and
    look at Carrie; we didn&#8217;t know until later, did we? Pregnancy is a personal
    thing, and shaming people undergoing it, with the added dimension of abortion,
    and pushing them into the spotlight in a public place&#8212;a public highway&#8212;violates
    this. As our chief superintendent put it, protesters can still protest; they have
    just moved a few hundred yards down the road.</p><p pid="e1314.2/11">Many MPs
    on both sides of the House who are supporting this Bill are devout Christians,
    and we should not muddy the waters of the issues at stake here. When that vicar&#8217;s
    daughter, <phrase class="honfriend" name="Joy Morrissey" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25878">the
    hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Joy Morrissey)</phrase>, was an Ealing councillor,
    she was a prime mover behind our PSPO, and local clergy, such as Nick Jones of
    Saint Mary, Acton, are completely 100% on side, as are a plethora of other groups:
    the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists,
    the Royal College of Midwives, the End Violence Against Women Coalition, Women&#8217;s
    Aid and Mumsnet to name but a few.</p><p pid="e1314.2/12">Australia and Canada
    have adopted this approach and this type of legislation functions fine, but we
    do not want to go down the road of America, where there are  horrific stories
    of medical professionals&#8217; cars being booby-trapped and all sorts of scary
    things; I fear we could head in that direction if action is not taken now.</p><p
    pid="e1314.2/13">This is not about the rights and wrongs of abortion. While emotions
    run high, and there are sincerely held opinions on both sides of the argument,
    we must accept that it has been legal for 50 years in this country. This is about
    the rights of vulnerable women seeking access to healthcare in safety, anonymity
    and dignity, without the accompanying paraphernalia designed to induce guilt,
    such as grossly inaccurate quasi-medical leaflets or being filmed and livestreamed
    entering and leaving the clinic, which no other medical procedure would attract.
    Access to health services should be a fundamental human right enjoyed by all without
    interference.</p><p pid="e1314.2/14">Following our buffer zone in Ealing, Richmond
    has followed suit, and apparently the constituencies of my good friends my hon.
    Friends the Members for Manchester, Withington (Jeff Smith) and for Birmingham,
    Edgbaston (Preet Kaur Gill) are next on the cards. Although Ealing&#8217;s PSPO
    was a necessary and local solution to a local problem,&#160;women should not effectively
    be in an uneven, patchy postcode lottery in order to be able to access harassment-free
    reproductive healthcare. This is a national problem that requires a national solution.
    Where Ealing leads, the world should follow, but we should better what Ealing
    has. This Government have been courageous with things such as same sex-marriage
    and they should be so again. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>'

    like all of us here, could not have foreseen the covid-19 pandemic when his Government
    initiated the process of leaving the European Union. 2020 has become a year like
    no other, and this Government must adapt and do what is right by their citizens.
    Our priority must be dealing with this health emergency and the consequent economic
    challenge; it is definitively not business as normal. That is why my Government
    in Edinburgh, under the stewardship of Nicola Sturgeon, has prioritised dealing
    with the crisis above all else. We are demanding that the UK Government do the
    same&#8212;[Interruption.] Mr Speaker, it has started already. This is a serious
    subject, and what we get is laughing and guffawing from <phrase class="honfriend"

    for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie)</phrase>. He really should
    show some respect and grow up.</p><p pid="b1523.3/4">The SNP is calling on the
    Government immediately to extend the Brexit transition period while we navigate
    the unprecedented health and economic crisis we currently face. The European Union
    has expressed its ongoing openness to extending the transition period for negotiations,
    and the UK Government now need to accept that offer. The Government will claim
    that this opportunity ended at the end of June, but we are dealing with realpolitik
    here. We know that while we are still in the transition period this House can
    legislate for an extension and the European Union would recognise the mutual benefit.
    It simply requires political will and leadership.</p><p pid="b1523.3/5">The Scottish
    Government have set out their position in &#8220;COVID-19: The Case for Extending
    the Brexit Transition Period&#8221;, which sets out why it is vital, if we are
    to ensure the most rapid recovery possible from the covid-19 crisis, that the
    UK must immediately seek an extension to the Brexit transition period for two
    years. We are in unprecedented times: a health pandemic, an economic crisis, and
    the real threat of a second wave of covid-19 later this year. Now is the moment
    for the UK Government to recognise reality and to reconsider their position.</p><p
    pid="b1523.3/6">The United Kingdom is facing an unprecedented economic crisis.
    The Office for Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England have published various
    scenarios in which GDP falls by as much as 13% to 14% this year, which would be
    the largest decline in economic output in 300 years. By comparison, the most recent
    largest single-year fall in GDP was 4.2% on the back of the financial crisis in
    2009. This overshadows anything that any of us we will ever face.</p><p pid="b1523.3/7">At
    least 1 million jobs have already gone, and many more will go when the Government
    end the furlough scheme, which is needed as a bridge to secure employment until
    recovery takes hold. Indeed, we know from the Office for Budget Responsibility
    that close to 2 million of those on the furlough scheme could face unemployment.
    Just dwell on that: the threat of unemployment in the UK could perhaps increase
    to as many as 4 million people. Just dwell on the human misery&#8212;the families
    struggling to make ends meet and pay their bills; a sharp rise in poverty, and
    the human cost of that for families and their children. That is why a stimulus
    package is required to build confidence and get folk back to work.</p>'

    are going on with Norway and the Faroes. I understand the level of interest, and
    of course I share it, but this is not the place to discuss the current position
    of those negotiations. The task before us tonight is to make progress with this
    important Bill. It is a framework Bill that gives us the power to implement whatever
    we obtain in the negotiations. The measures in the Bill are required regardless
    of the outcome of the negotiations, and we must press on with our legislative
    programme.</p><p pid="b124.0/3">The Bill has been developed in collaboration with
    the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Administrations, and with their help
    it has been improved. As <phrase class="honfriend" name="Alistair Carmichael"
    person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10785">the right hon. Member for Orkney and

    for other UK bills, the co-operative working between officials and indeed ministers
    in the Scottish Government, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
    and the other devolved Administrations has demonstrated what can be achieved&#8221;.</p><p
    pid="b124.0/5">At their request, this Bill gives the devolved Administrations
    more powers than ever to manage their fisheries. This is an opportunity to create
    tailored approaches to fisheries management across the UK.</p><p pid="b124.0/6">I
    pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Douglas Ross" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25531">the

    that the Scottish industry is well represented in this House, as those Members
    take a great interest in every decision that is taken.</p><p pid="b124.0/7">In
    a perceptive speech, the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said that there
    is a great deal of consensus for what the Bill is trying to achieve, and many
    Members from across the House spoke about getting the balance right&#8212;namely,
    the complexities of managing a diverse ecosystem with the interests of an equally
    diverse fishing fleet.</p><p pid="b124.0/8">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Theresa Villiers" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11500">the Member
    for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers)</phrase> made a stand-out speech. Of course,
    she helped to craft the Bill, and spoke passionately about its aims and objectives.</p><p
    pid="b124.0/9">We heard some superb and wide-ranging Back-Bench speeches from
    across the House. The issue of safety was rightly raised on both Front Benches,
    and most passionately by my hon. Friends the Members for South East Cornwall (Mrs

    (Sarah Owen)</phrase>, who I welcome back from maternity leave, and many more
    Members across the House. Much work is being done on the issue. As Members have
    said, there is absolutely no need to wait for the outcome of the Bill to do this
    important work, and it is right to say that the Department for Transport, the
    Marine and Coastguard Agency, and Seafish are working hard on this issue. Unusual
    though it may be, I pay tribute to the shadow Secretary of State for the work
    that he has done to raise this issue again and again in this place. It is not
    a matter particularly for tonight&#8217;s debate, but definitely a matter of concern
    to all of us in this House&#8212;and that should have been heard loud and clear.</p><p
    pid="b124.0/10">Other speeches that stood out for me included that of the former
    Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Robert Goodwill"
    person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11804">the Member for Scarborough and Whitby
    (Mr Goodwill)</phrase>, who gave us an important historical round-up of why we
    are here.  On the specific point that he raised, I will ask the Scallop Industry
    Consultation Group to raise the issue of gear conflict. I undertake to report
    back to him on that.</p><p pid="b124.0/11">Many Members encouraged us to eat more
    local fish and to promote British seafood, and many noted what had been done during
    the pandemic to support that and said how much more direct selling was being undertaken
    at the moment. I refer specifically to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Lia Nici" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25865">the Member for Great
    Grimsby (Lia Nici)</phrase>, who represents the proud port of Grimsby, my hon.
    Friends the Members for Totnes (Anthony Mangnall), for West Dorset (Chris Loder),
    for North West Durham (Mr Holden) and for Witney (Robert Courts)&#8212;all of
    them proud eaters of seafood who were encouraging their constituents to be the
    same&#8212;and, of course, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Sir
    David Amess" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10009">the Member for Southend
    West (Sir David Amess)</phrase>. I am not sure that it is Government policy yet
    that Southend should become a city, but there can be no doubt that he sticks up
    for the rights of his fishing industry and the rights of his people to eat what
    they produce.</p><p pid="b124.0/12">We also heard some passionate speeches about
    the marine environment from <phrase class="honfriend" name="Kerry McCarthy" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11455">the
    hon. Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase
    class="honfriend" name="Robert Courts" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25593">the
    Member for Witney (Robert Courts)</phrase>. The strong voice of Cornwall was heard
    around the Chamber and, indeed, acknowledged by <phrase class="honfriend" name="Dave
    Doogan" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25796">the hon. Member for Angus (Dave
    Doogan)</phrase>, who accepted that many of the issues raised mirror those of
    his own fishermen. It is great to have so many Cornish colleagues who, in their
    own words, would say that they had done a proper job at standing up for the industry.
    My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Cherilyn Mackrory" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25802">the
    Member for Truro and Falmouth (Cherilyn Mackrory)</phrase>, who is married to
    a fisherman, cannot be here tonight, but we heard strongly about the worries that
    Cornish colleagues have about the inshore fleet. I would like to reassure them
    that we are working with a number of recently formed groups&#8212;again, supported
    by Seafish&#8212;to collaborate on more sustainable management for specific stocks
    such as whelks and crabs. We have noted that parts of the industry have had louder
    voices than others in the past, and these new groups are an attempt to address
    that.</p><p pid="b124.0/13">I should also mention the work of REAF, the Renaissance
    of East Anglian Fisheries, which was referred to by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="James Wild" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25866">the Member for North
    West Norfolk (James Wild)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Peter Aldous" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24904">the Member for
    Waveney (Peter Aldous)</phrase>, who mentions it frequently in this place. Its
    report contains some excellent ideas, which the Government will continue to look
    into.</p><p pid="b124.0/14">Fisheries management plans will revolutionise how
    we manage our precious fisheries. They will allow us to take a holistic approach
    to management, managing fisheries at an appropriate level, not fettered by lines
    on maps or differences between inshore and offshore, between Inshore Fisheries
    and Conservation Authorities districts or even between Administrations. We will
    continue to work with industry and interested parties in a much closer way, developing
    plans together and ensuring that we use the best possible evidence and local knowledge,
    so that we can create a management for fisheries that is truly appropriate.</p><p
    pid="b124.0/15">A number of Members mentioned funding. Of course, with a fairer
    share of fish and more opportunities, we expect that profitability and investment
    in the sector will increase. However, we recognise that this will take time, so
    I would like to restate that the Government will  maintain funding for fisheries
    across the UK&#8217;s nations throughout the Parliament, as we said in our manifesto
    commitment. The Bill provides new, expanded funding powers, which will allow us
    to fund infrastructure such as port development and training&#8212;I see the right
    hon. Member for Tynemouth nodding; I know that that has long been a concern of
    his. These new domestic funding schemes will support our priorities, and as a
    devolved matter, each Administration will lead on their own programme.</p><p pid="b124.0/16">We
    all recognise the importance of the inshore sector, not just our Cornish colleagues.
    I am really pleased that, over the summer, tourists have been able to travel to
    our coastal communities and enjoy the very best of what our seas have to offer.
    As a family, we enjoyed some wonderful weather in Tenby over the weekend. It has
    been rather a shock to come back, straight into this important Bill. I would like
    to take this opportunity to congratulate those seafood businesses that have adapted
    and innovated as a result of the pandemic and are encouraging more and more people
    to eat locally caught and directly sourced fish. We are determined to continue
    to work on this as a Government; it is a real priority for us.</p><p pid="b124.0/17">Fishing
    is a key part of our heritage as an island nation. The injustices felt by so many
    concerning the common fisheries policy loomed large in the debate over our decision
    to leave the EU. This Bill gives us the opportunity to put that right and reclaim
    our position as an independent coastal state. It is a framework Bill, and I look
    forward to working across the House to put meat on the bones of the Bill, but
    it does what it needs to do, which is give us the powers we need to act in a flexible
    and responsive way, providing sustainable fisheries for future generations. I
    commend the Bill to the House.</p><p pid="b124.0/18">Question put, That the amendment

    pid="f688.2/3">Today&#8217;s debate follows a chaotic summer of distress and dismay
    for young people, their families and their teachers. The system for awarding examination
    grades that the Secretary of State for Education put in place left thousands of
    young people devastated. When they received their results, they felt that they
    had been robbed of the opportunities they deserved by a flawed algorithm that
    the Secretary of State had pushed for. As events unfolded, the scale of the Government&#8217;s
    incompetence became obvious. Less than two days before the A-level results, new
    grounds for appeal were announced, ones that Ofqual has since said were never
    going to be workable. On results day itself, the Prime Minister and Secretary
    of State insisted the system was robust, even as it was unravelling around them.
    Two days after, the Secretary of State said there would be &#8220;no U-turn, no
    change&#8221;, but days later a U-turn was made. After days of campaigning by
    students, their families and the Labour party, the Government accepted that students
    should be awarded their centre-assessed grades. That was the right decision, but
    this shambles is no way to run a country.</p>

    and the economy.&#8221;</p><p pid="b47.0/3">There are two questions at the heart
    of the Bill and of why we will oppose it tonight. First, how do we get an internal
    market after <phrase class="date" code="2020-01-01">1 January</phrase> within
    the UK while upholding the devolution settlements, which have been a vital part
    of our constitution for two decades and are essential to our Union? Secondly,
    will our country abide by the rule of law&#8212;a rules-based international order,
    for which we are famous around the world and have always stood up?</p><p pid="b47.0/4">Those
    are not small questions. They go to the heart of who we are as a country and the
    character of this Government. Let me start with the first question. An internal
    market is vital for trade and jobs at home, but also for our ability to strike
    trade deals. It is the responsibility of the UK Government at Westminster to safeguard
    that market and legislate. On that, we agree with the Government. But that must
    be done while understanding that the governance of our country has changed in
    the last two decades. Two decades of devolution settlements reflect a decision
    that we would share power across our four nations, including devolving key powers
    over issues such as animal welfare, food safety and aspects of environmental legislation.
    We should legislate for an internal market, but in a way that respects the role
    and voice of devolved Governments in setting those standards. That is to respect
    the devolution settlement. From across the UK, we have heard that the Government
    are not doing that; that they want to legislate with a blunderbuss approach that
    does not do that and simply says that the lowest standard in one Parliament must
    become the standard for all, with no proper voice for devolved Governments. If
    the Westminster Government decided to lower standards, there would be no voice
    for the devolved nations, even in a discussion about those standards because the
    Government have decided not to legislate for common frameworks.</p>

    of the most professional and capable people this country has. They risk their
    lives to keep us safe, uphold our values and support society whenever the call
    comes. I know the exceptional and often dangerous tasks that we ask them to do,
    and the war memorials sadly record the price of that sacrifice that they sometimes
    have to make. Our support for them should not be confined to the occasional act
    of remembrance, but should be real and should recognise the things that they do
    in our name.</p><p pid="c984.3/3">In 2004, Phil Shiner, a lawyer, went fishing.
    He fished for stories, he fished for victims and he fished for terrorists. Phil
    Shiner and his company, Public Interest Lawyers, fished for people from whom he
    could make money and to accuse British troops of wrongdoing. By the time Phil
    Shiner and his like had finished, he had dragged before the courts 1,400 judicial
    reviews and 234 compensation claims against hundreds of troops. Alongside him
    on some of those occasions was another law firm that will be, I am afraid, all
    too familiar to some on the Opposition Benches&#8212;Leigh Day. From 2008, those
    types of firms hauled industrial levels of claims before the courts&#8212;never
    mind the fear and worry and the endless investigations triggered into the men
    and women of our armed forces. What mattered to the ambulance chasers was the

    broken international law. He knows it. He could not answer, and did not attempt
    to answer, whether he thought the Iraq war was lawful.</p><p pid="d297.0/3">The
    bottom line is that the completely irrelevant questions raised in relation to
    breaches of international law are completely unfounded. The reality is that this
    country has on occasion in the past, in its own national interest for the sake
    of preserving its sovereignty and its economic sovereignty, had to occasionally
    break international obligations. There is no doubt about that, but equally and
    by the same token this Bill is about the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and
    preserving the economic sovereignty of the internal market and doing what it can
    to preserve the Union in all its character and territoriality. The right hon.
    Member for Doncaster North shakes his head, but the bottom line is that we have
    now got this Bill through. It has gone through with 100 votes time and again.
    That proves the point. This is the endorsement of the referendum. This is the
    endorsement of the manner in which the British people voted in the general election

    of this country and to maintain its sovereignty.</p><p pid="d297.0/4">Six hours

    spoken during the passage of the Bill so far. We have had around 30 hours of often
    passionate debate, and I pay tribute to Members across the House for their contributions.
    The Public Bill Office has been unstinting in its support to all Members and officials
    across Government, and I am incredibly grateful for all its work. I particularly
    wish to thank the Minister for Small Business, Consumers and Labour Markets, my
    hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Paul Scully" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25331">the

    of our shared economic and social prosperity as a country. Since the Acts of Union,
    it has been the source of unhindered and open trade, which has supported growth
    and safeguarded livelihoods and businesses. It demonstrates that, as a Union,
    our country is greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p pid="d282.3/4">Since 1973,
    EU law has acted as the cohering force for the UK internal market. In 2016, the
    British people voted to leave the European Union, which the Government delivered
    in January, and as we leave the transition period at the end of this year, the
    Government will leave the European Union&#8217;s legal jurisdiction once and for
    all. We need to replace this law to continue the smooth functioning of our centuries-old
    internal market, while of course also ensuring that the devolved Administrations
    benefit from a power surge from Brussels.</p>

  tidied_motion: That the temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020 should
    not yet expire.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="d388.1/1">I beg to move,</p><p class="indent" pid="d388.1/2"
    pwmotiontext="yes">That the temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020 should
    not yet expire.</p><p pid="d388.1/3">When we first introduced the Act in March,
    I said that coronavirus is the most serious public health emergency that the world
    has faced in a century. Now, six months later, it is still the most serious public
    health emergency that the world has faced in a century. We have worked hard, overwhelmingly
    across party lines and sometimes at great pace, and come together to slow the
    spread of this virus. With the help of this Act, we protected the NHS, we built
    the Nightingale hospitals, and we welcomed thousands of clinicians back to the
    frontline. The Act helped people to get more appropriate care, faster; it helped
    the NHS and social care to harness technology like never before; and it has allowed
    the Government to deliver unprecedented economic support in troubled times. Although
    we have made huge strides in expanding testing and huge progress toward a vaccine,
    with the virus still at large, the Coronavirus Act 2020 and the measures within
    it remain as important as then.</p><p pid="d388.1/4">Our strategy is to suppress
    the virus while protecting the economy, education and the NHS until a vaccine
    makes us safe. The Act is still needed to keep people safe. I understand that
    these are extraordinary measures, but they remain temporary, time-limited and
    proportionate to the threat that we face. Some of the measures we seek not to
    renew; some have, thankfully, not been used, but it is imperative that we maintain
    the ability to use them if needed; and some of the measures have proved critical
    to our response and are now used to keep people safe every day. To stand down
    the Act now would leave Britain exposed at a time when we need to be at our strongest.</p><p
    pid="d388.1/5">This virus moves quickly, so we need to have the powers at our
    disposal to respond quickly. It is deeply important to me that we strike the right
    balance between acting at pace and proper scrutiny. I believe in the sovereignty
    of Parliament, I believe that scrutinised decisions are better decisions, and
    I believe in the wisdom of this House as the cockpit of the nation.</p><p pid="d388.1/6">This
    has been an unprecedented time. This House has had to do many unprecedented things,
    many of which have been uncomfortable. I have listened to the concerns raised
    about scrutiny. As you pointed out earlier, Mr Speaker, there have been times
    when this pandemic has challenged us all and we have not been able to do this
    as well as we would have liked. I therefore propose that we change the approach
    to bringing in urgent measures. I am very grateful to all colleagues we have worked
    with to come forward with a proposal that will allow us to make decisions and
    implement them fast, yet also ensure that they are scrutinised properly.</p><p
    pid="d388.1/7">Today, I can confirm to the House that for significant national
    measures with effect in the whole of England or UK-wide, we will consult Parliament;
    wherever possible, we will hold votes before such regulations come into force.
    But of course, responding to the virus means that the Government must act with
    speed when required, and we cannot hold up urgent regulations that are  needed
    to control the virus and save lives. I am sure that no Member of this House would
    want to limit the Government&#8217;s ability to take emergency action in the national
    interest, as we did in March.</p><p pid="d388.1/8">We will continue to involve
    the House in scrutinising our decisions in the way my right hon. Friend the Prime
    Minister set out last week, with regular statements and debates, and the ability
    for Members to question the Government&#8217;s scientific advisers more regularly,
    gain access to data about their constituencies and join daily calls with my right
    hon. Friend the Paymaster General. I hope these new arrangements will be welcomed
    on both sides of the House, and I will continue to listen to colleagues&#8217;
    concerns, as I have tried my best to do throughout.</p>

  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b652.3/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a
    Second time.</p><p pid="b652.3/2">This legislation is being introduced to keep
    our country safe and to ensure that our operational agencies and public authorities
    have access to the tools and intelligence that they need to keep us safe&#8212;safe
    from terrorists, safe from serious organised crime groups, and safe from others
    who wish to cause harm to our country and our citizens. Specifically, the Bill
    deals with participation in criminal conduct by covert human intelligence sources&#8212;so-called
    CHIS. These are agents, or undercover officers, who help to secure prosecutions
    and disruptions by infiltrating criminal and terrorist groups.</p><p pid="b652.3/3">Throughout
    history, those entrusted to uphold the law or safeguard national security have
    used covert human intelligence to support and progress their activity. From Sir
    Francis Walsingham&#8217;s use of informers to defend the reign of Elizabeth I
    from internal and external threats, to the deployments by the newly formed detective
    units of the Metropolitan police in the latter half of the 19th century, to the
    double-cross system in the second world war, covert human intelligence has always
    been a vital part of our national security and law enforcement framework.</p><p
    pid="b652.3/4">More recently, though, CHIS have been critical in identifying and
    disrupting terrorist plots, drugs and firearms offences, child sexual exploitation
    and abuse, and other serious organised crime. Since March 2017, MI5 and counter-terrorism
    police have together thwarted some 27 terror attacks. As the director general
    of MI5 said when the Bill was introduced:</p><p class="indent" pid="b652.3/5"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Without the contribution of human agents, be in no doubt&#8230;these
    attacks would not have been prevented.&#8221;</p><p pid="b652.3/6">I have been
    advised that between November 2018 and 2019 CHIS operations within the Metropolitan
    police area alone led to 3,500 arrests, the recovery of more than 100 firearms
    and 400 other weapons, the seizure of more than 400 kg of class A drugs, and the
    recovery of more than &#163;2.5 million in cash. Similarly, CHIS operations in
    2019 alone enabled the National Crime Agency to safeguard several hundred victims
    of crime, including from child sexual exploitation and abuse. This is an important
    and unique tactic; by working their way into the heart of criminal groups, CHIS
    are able to access intelligence that other investigatory powers may simply never
    detect.</p>

    Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020&#8212;the major lockdown regulations&#8212;were
    introduced on March 26. Those regulations outlined restrictions on gathering and
    required a number of businesses to close. The regulations were amended four times
    as we opened up the economy and allowed for technical clarifications. They were
    then revoked and replaced by the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions)
    (No. 2) (England) Regulations 2020. Those regulations had been amended three times
    prior to <phrase class="date" code="2020-09-13">13 September</phrase> to allow
    more businesses to reopen, as the transmission of the virus was falling or stabilising.
    Unfortunately, as winter approaches, the picture has changed and we now need to
    introduce tighter restrictions to control the virus, protect the NHS and save
    lives.</p>

    support areas with additional local restrictions, currently the North of England

    letting them go; ensuring no-one is pushed into poverty when they do the right
    thing; providing clear, consistent and fair funding that goes hand-in-hand with
    the imposition of new restrictions, including using the £1.3 billion underspend
    on the grants fund to support local jobs; fixing gaps in support for the self-employed;
    and extending the ban on evictions.

    health against our economy, but we all know that our country has suffered a double
    tragedy: the highest excess death rate in Europe and the deepest recession in
    the G7. The predominant reason why many expect our recovery to proceed more slowly
    than that in other countries is the continued severe impact of the public health
    crisis in the UK. It has been suggested that the Chancellor blocked proposals
    from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies for a circuit breaker. He can
    now, if he wishes to, intervene on me and set the record straight.</p>'

    to play us off against each other across GM. Well, let me tell the Prime Minister:
    our Mayor stood up for Greater Manchester, but he spoke for Great Britain. Indeed,
    his call for Parliament to have a say and a vote on these measures is one that
    so many Government Members have made.</p>'

  question: The Deputy Speaker put forthwith the Question already proposed from the
    Chair (Standing Order No. 83E), That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="d274.0/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
    Third time.</p><p pid="d274.0/2">First, I acknowledge the hard work that has got
    us to this point today and the thousands who responded to our public consultation
    and shaped the measures in the Bill, as well as the legal and legislative experts
    who have ensured that it provides measured and calibrated protections. I thank
    Members from all parties who have participated in debating the Bill&#8217;s merits,
    including in Committee. In particular, I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for
    Defence People and Veterans. His passion and determination to do the right thing
    by personnel and veterans is genuine and his commitment to his cause is unwavering.
    Such central determination and duty should be a lesson to us all.</p><p pid="d274.0/3">The
    Bill is more than just a manifesto commitment; it is a necessary and overdue strengthening
    of the legal framework for dealing with the vexatious claims and repeated investigations
    that have arisen from recent overseas military operations. There have been many
    inaccurate and wild accusations about the measures in the Bill. It does not prevent
    armed forces personnel from being prosecuted for crimes they may have committed.
    It does not remove prosecutors&#8217; independence or ability to prosecute on
    the basis of any new or compelling evidence of any crime at any time. It does
    not undermine the UK&#8217;s adherence to the UN convention against torture, its
    commitment to international law or its willingness to investigate and prosecute
    any alleged criminal offences. As such, it does not increase the likelihood of
    International Criminal Court prosecutions.</p><p pid="d274.0/4">But do not take
    my word for it; take the words of the former Attorney General for Northern Ireland,
    John Larkin QC, probably the lawyer most experienced in dealing with legacy military
    and security investigations across the United Kingdom, who said in a paper published
    this September that</p><p class="indent" pid="d274.0/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;the
    Bill does not create, or come close to creating, &#8216;de facto immunity&#8217;
    for serving or former service personnel in respect of serious crimes.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="d274.0/6">However, the Bill does raise the threshold for prosecution, thereby
    reducing the likelihood of investigations being repeatedly reopened without new
    and compelling evidence. It does ensure recognition of the unique circumstances
    of overseas operations, including the constant threat to life and repeated exposure
    to traumatic events. It does take into consideration the public interest in criminal
    and civil cases&#8217; being brought to a timely resolution, so that the courts
    can assess them while memories are fresh and evidence is more readily available.
    That is entirely in line with the principles of the ECHR. In short, the measures
    do provide greater protection from the likes of Phil Shiner Solicitors, whose
    motivations were not justice but money.</p><p pid="d274.0/7">It is the right thing
    to do to defend the men and women who risk their lives to protect us. It is for
    all these reasons that the House should support the Bill&#8217;s Third Reading.
    But it is just one piece in the jigsaw to fix this issue. Let us not forget that
    the overwhelming number of these incidents that triggered the pursuit of veterans
    happened under Labour&#8217;s stewardship of defence. They failed to keep training
    compliance with the ECHR. They failed to equip personnel properly. They failed
    to reform the service justice system to ensure that they were ECHR-article 2-compliant,
    including <phrase class="honfriend" name="Kevan Jones" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11003">the
    right hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, who was a Minister in
    that Ministry at that time, so it is a bit rich&#8212;</p>

    come together today to implement time-limited restrictions across England from
    midnight, so that we can contain the autumn surge of the virus, protect our NHS
    and save many lives. Of course, this is not something that any of us wanted to
    do. None of us came into politics to tell people once again to shutter their shops,
    furlough their staff or stay away from their friends and family. In common with
    all Members, I feel the pain and anxiety that we will all share in the month ahead.
    But as Prime Minister, when I am confronted with data which projects that our
    NHS could even collapse, with deaths in the second wave potentially exceeding
    those of the first, and when I look at what is happening among some of our continental
    friends and see doctors who have tested positive being ordered to work on covid
    wards and patients airlifted to hospitals in some other countries simply to make
    space, I can reach only one conclusion: I am not prepared to take the risk with
    the lives of the British people.</p><p pid="e331.2/4">I know it might be tempting
    to think that, because some progress has been made, we just need to stay the course
    and see through our locally led approach. It is true that the extraordinary efforts
    of millions across the country&#8212;especially those in high and very high alert
    level areas&#8212;have made a difference, suppressing the reproduction rate of
    the virus below where it would otherwise have been. I want to record again my
    thanks to the millions who have put up with local restrictions. I want to thank
    the local leaders who have understood the gravity of the position.</p><p pid="e331.2/5">But
    I am sorry to say that the number of covid patients in some hospitals is already
    higher than at the peak of the first wave. Even in the south-west, which has so
    far had lower case rates than most of the rest of the country, hospital admissions
    are over halfway to their first-wave peak. The latest analysis from the Scientific
    Advisory Group for Emergencies, published on Friday, suggests that the R remains
    above 1 in every part of England, which means that the virus is continuing to
    grow among the population. Every day that the number is above 1 is another day
    that the number of cases will rise, locking in more hospital admissions and, alas,
    more fatalities, pushing the NHS ever closer to the moment when it cannot cope.</p>'

    are still a few outstanding areas, which have gone back and forth between the
    Houses, and I will outline the Government&#8217;s rationale for why we cannot
    accept the proposals as drafted. I will begin by speaking about the approach to
    exclusions taken by the Bill, which is a shared point across amendments 1F, 1G,
    1H, 1J, 1K, 1L and 8M. I will then address the specifics of the common frameworks
    amendments and wider market access exclusions.</p><p pid="a169.4/5">As I said
    last week, and as my noble friends Lord Callanan and Lord True said in the other
    place yesterday, the Government have been clear throughout these debates that
    we agree that there is a need for an exclusions regime. However, it has to be
    carefully drafted and provide certainty for business. In drafting the Bill, and
    clauses 10 and 17 specifically, the Government have designed an exclusions approach
    that achieves a careful balance. Both the noble and learned Lord Hope and Lord
    Stevenson have narrowed the scope of their amendments and I thank them both for
    their continued dialogue with the Government on those. Our assessment remains,
    however, that the approach in both sets of amendments goes too far both in the
    breadth of exclusions that it would require the Secretary of State to create and
    the uncertainty that it would lead to. These amendments would be detrimental to
    the clarity, simplicity and certainty that the Bill intends to provide.</p>

    pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that the Government should stop the
    planned cut in Universal Credit and Working Tax Credit in April and give certainty
    today to the six million families for whom it is worth an extra &#163;1,000 a
    year.</p><p pid="e637.3/3">I am not here to claim that Conservative MPs are heartless,
    lack compassion, or have insufficient regard for the poorest people in this country.
    I know that after the vote on free school meals, many Conservative MPs, mainly
    after comments made by other Conservative MPs, received a high degree of personal
    abuse, and I want to make it clear unequivocally that that is wrong. I am here
    to put forward a clear and, I believe, compelling case that reducing universal
    credit and working tax credit this April would be fundamentally the wrong decision.
    It would be a profound mistake for families, for the economy and for our ability
    to effectively tackle and recover from the covid pandemic.</p><p pid="e637.3/4">Before
    putting forward that case, I wish to address the Prime Minister&#8217;s suggestion
    that Parliament is somehow not the right place to have this discussion. Opposition
    days have been a feature of our parliamentary system for many decades. They were
    used very successfully by the Conservative party when it was in opposition&#8212;for
    example, when the Labour Government were defeated over resettlement rights for
    Gurkhas in 2009, or over post office closures. All majority Governments, except
    this one, have accepted that if they cannot win a vote in Parliament on one of
    their policies, then they have to change that policy. This decision cannot be
    deferred until a Budget, because the Government cancelled the November Budget
    and have not brought forward a Finance Bill since March.</p><p pid="e637.3/5">I
    put it to all Members that Parliament is exactly the right place to have a discussion
    of such consequence to the country. The Government cannot expect to preach parliamentary
    sovereignty one week, and run away from parliamentary scrutiny the next. Too often,
    the Prime Minister seems unwilling to abide by basic democratic norms and to accept
    proper scrutiny and accountability. We have seen in the US where that can end.</p><p
    pid="e637.3/6">Let me also say at the outset that, throughout the pandemic, the
    Opposition have always sought to be constructive. The official Opposition want
    the national strategy to succeed. In that spirit, we welcomed the changes that
    the Government made to universal credit at the beginning of the crisis. The &#163;20-a-week
    weekly increase, and the suspension of conditionality and the minimum income floor,
    were necessary steps to support people. Recognition must also go to frontline
    Department for Work and Pensions staff, who kept our social security system going
    through the early stages of the crisis, making sure that hundreds of thousands
    of new claimants  received the support they needed. All those staff deserve our

    illiterate to push up taxes while the economy is in crisis; and it is dishonest

    cladding crisis; and update Parliament once a month in the form of a Written Ministerial
    Statement by the Secretary of State.</p><p pid="b685.2/3">Buying your first home
    is a life-defining moment. It is exciting and scary. It symbolises security, and
    the time to start a family and build a future, but for so many what was a dream
    come true has become a nightmare. The Grenfell tragedy shed light on a crisis
    of building safety in this country, and hundreds of buildings have the same cladding
    that caused the Grenfell fire to be so deadly. Thousands have other equally dangerous
    cladding, and even more have other serious fire safety problems, such as combustible
    insulation, missing fire breaks and faulty fire doors. Millions of homeowners
    are caught up in the wider building safety crisis caused by the defects and are
    unable to sell, remortgage or buy a flat, freezing up 16% of the housing market
    and affecting possibly as many as 11 million people.</p><p pid="b685.2/4">It can
    be easy to get caught up in the vast numbers, but it truly is a human tragedy.
    Many in this House will have read or heard Hayley&#8217;s story. Hayley was a
    first-time buyer in Leeds. She bought her flat through an affordable housing scheme
    designed to help people on low incomes take that first step on to the housing
    ladder. After moving in, Hayley was told that the roof of her building was covered
    in dangerous cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower, and further inspections
    threw up more problems with brickwork, insulation, balconies and possibly firebreaks.</p><p
    pid="b685.2/5">Every month, Hayley faced an additional &#163;300 in charges for
    what is called a waking watch&#8212;a 24-hour fire safety patrol that gives little
    confidence but costs dearly. That &#163;300 a month was as much as her mortgage,
    and she just could not afford it. The terms of her mortgage meant that she could
    not move or rent our her flat. Facing mounting bills for the repairs, fire alarms
    and the looming threat of the costs of fixing the building, Hayley declared bankruptcy.
    A first-time buyer so recently, Hayley would now struggle to take out a loan to
    buy a car.</p><p pid="b685.2/6">However, the crisis is not just affecting those
    at the beginning of their housing journey. I was written to recently by an elderly
    constituent who wants to move out of his flat and into a home that better suits
    his mobility needs. His block does not have dangerous cladding, but misguided
    advice from the Government means that he cannot get a survey to prove it. His
    home cannot be mortgaged, so he cannot get a buyer and so he cannot move into
    a home where he can be comfortable.</p><p pid="b685.2/7">The situation is reflected
    across the country. People are being forced to pay more than they can afford for
    a problem they did not cause. Some are paying so much that they cannot keep their
    home: first-time buyers getting on  the housing ladder to secure their future;
    people trying to move up and start a family; people approaching or in retirement
    wanting somewhere smaller; key workers such as NHS junior doctor Will, also in
    the media today, working on the covid frontline in Sheffield and facing costs
    of &#163;52,000, a doubling service charge each month and skyrocketing insurance
    costs; housing associations, councils and their tenants; and everyone in between.</p><p
    pid="b685.2/8">Everyone in this House, I think, agrees that this intolerable situation
    must not go on. People cannot continue living in unsafe homes. Leaseholders should
    not face mounting bills for a crisis they did not cause. Labour&#8217;s motion
    today expresses three simple principles that we hope will receive endorsement
    from across the House. First, the Government must urgently establish how much
    unsafe cladding there is, where it is and what danger it poses. It is extraordinary,
    three and a half years on from Grenfell, that we still do not have such basic
    information. Immediately after Grenfell, the Government could have done as Victoria
    in Australia did and set up a taskforce to establish the extent of dangerous cladding,
    prioritised by risk, and ensured enforcement against those who refuse to undertake
    the work. We are calling on the Government to do that today.</p><p pid="b685.2/9">Many
    leaseholders are discovering that there is a shortage of engineers and fire safety
    specialists to carry out inspections and works. The Victoria taskforce manages
    the supply chain and ensures that it is directed first to the buildings that are
    most at risk. It has also prioritised safety by ensuring that the highest-risk
    buildings are fixed first, rather than the first come, first served approach that
    the UK Government are currently taking.</p><p pid="b685.2/10">Secondly, people&#8217;s
    homes should be made safe as soon as possible. Where there is dangerous cladding
    on buildings or other serious fire safety problems, that must be fixed immediately.
    All the big players in this crisis have spent the past few years pointing fingers
    and avoiding responsibility, and the Government have called on building owners
    to do the right thing, but there is nothing to prevent building owners from passing
    on costs to leaseholders, and indeed they have a fiduciary duty to do so in many
    cases. Leaseholders simply cannot afford it, and they simply should not have to.
    If someone bought a new car that turned out to be dangerous, they would not expect
    to be told to take out a loan of tens of thousands of pounds to pay for it&#8212;often
    more than the price of the original car&#8212;but here we are talking about people&#8217;s
    homes. The stalemate we have now is leaving hundreds of thousands of people stuck
    in flammable buildings, and the only way to make homes safe is for the Government
    provide up-front funding to make that happen.</p><p pid="b685.2/11">Finally, the
    cost of the work should not fall on leaseholders or taxpayers. Residents did not
    cause this crisis. They bought their homes in good faith only to find themselves
    victim to years of corporate malpractice, Government inaction and a broken leasehold
    system. Ministers have promised at least 15 times that leaseholders would not
    bear the cost, but recently the language has shifted to state that they should
    not bear &#8220;unaffordable&#8221; costs, and there is talk of loans. Labour&#8217;s
    motion calls on them to reaffirm and put substance behind their original promises
    to leaseholders.</p><p pid="b685.2/12">Neither should the taxpayer carry the burden.
    The Government should pursue the dodgy developers, cowboy builders and manufacturers
    of flammable cladding through  legal action&#8212;that is the &#8220;polluter
    pays&#8221; principle. Where laws need to be changed to make that easier, we should
    do so. There is precedent for that in Australia. Many councils and social landlords
    are being stung for the cost of the remediation. The Government have set them
    two impossible tasks: build to the building targets they have set, and at the
    same time carry out expensive fire remediation without passing on the costs to
    hard-pressed tenants. That must also change.</p><p pid="b685.2/13">I am a Member
    of Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition, but I am not here to score party political
    points. We know that at least 34 Conservative MPs agree that leaseholders should
    not pay for these costs, and I am sure there are many more who have not yet said
    so publicly. I commend in particular the work of the hon. Members for Stevenage
    (Stephen McPartland) and for Southampton, Itchen (Royston Smith) on the Fire Safety
    Bill. Their amendments sought to protect leaseholders and push the Government
    to take action. We have tabled our own amendments that build on theirs and fill
    in some gaps, but the Government have not said when the Fire Safety Bill will
    come back, and the end of this parliamentary Session is rumoured to be fast approaching.</p><p
    pid="b685.2/14">The Government may say that Opposition day motions are not binding,
    but it is up to them if they choose not to be bound by the sovereign will of the
    country&#8217;s elected representatives in this House. Many people remember that
    when the Labour Government were defeated on an Opposition day motion on Gurkhas,
    they honoured the will of Parliament and changed the policy the very next day.
    I ask the Government to heed the will of this House.</p><p pid="b685.2/15">Further
    delay and inaction is not an option. Building insurance will continue to skyrocket
    and the unaffordable cost of waking watch security guards will continue. On top
    of all that, the colossal cost for fixing buildings will fall on leaseholders.
    People will go broke. Mortgages risk going into negative equity on a massive scale
    as more and more flats become literally valueless. We need a solution to this
    crisis that fixes buildings and ensures that those responsible pay.</p><p pid="b685.2/16">I
    pay tribute to the absolutely inspiring cladding campaigners. I have met some
    in my constituency of Bristol West and others from across the country along with
    my colleague, the excellent shadow Minister for housing and housing safety, my
    hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Mike Amesbury" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25702">the
    Member for Weaver Vale (Mike Amesbury)</phrase>. Those residents just want to
    get on with their lives. It is a tribute to all of them that they keep campaigning.
    So many MPs tried to get on to the speaking list today that they could not all
    get on. I commend colleagues for standing up for lease-holders, whether they are
    able to speak today or not.</p><p pid="b685.2/17">There is cross-party consensus&#8212;agreement
    across both Houses and across the country&#8212;that we should put the needs of
    those first-time buyers, key workers and pensioners first. I am not asking Members
    to vote with the Opposition; I am asking them to vote with their constituents
    to show that they will always put their interests first. If Members agree with
    what is in the motion, they should vote for it. It is as simple as that.</p>'

    pid="b752.1/3">I am grateful to the Minister for coming to speak in today&#8217;s
    debate. I think it is the first time that I have appeared opposite her in one
    of these debates.</p><p pid="b752.1/4">Last week, the country passed the heartbreaking
    milestone of 100,000 deaths as a result of this awful pandemic. I know that everyone
    across the House mourns all those lost, and we think today of all the families
    up and down the country for whom life will never be the same again.</p><p pid="b752.1/5">Our
    United Kingdom is a country of incredible resources and many of the world&#8217;s
    finest scientists. It has the dedication and brilliance of our wonderful NHS and
    care workers&#8212;indeed, all our frontline workers&#8212;and yet we have still
    ended up with the worst death toll in Europe and the worst economic hit of any
    major country. We have to learn the lessons fast. More than 50,000 people who
    died as a result of this awful virus in the UK died since <phrase class="date"
    code="2021-11-11">11 November</phrase>. We have to ask why the United Kingdom
    has fared so badly, not as some sort of academic exercise, but to save lives.</p><p
    pid="b752.1/6">In recent days, the Government&#8217;s chief scientific adviser
    said:</p><p class="indent" pid="b752.1/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;You&#8217;ve
    got to go hard, early and broader if you&#8217;re going to get on top of this.
    Waiting and watching simply doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p><p pid="b752.1/8">That
    is the lesson that he is advising the Government to draw: to go wider when they
    can. But are Ministers really learning that lesson?</p><p pid="b752.1/9">We are
    an island country. Our border protections should have been one of our strengths
    throughout this pandemic, unlike countries that have very long land borders that
    they would have had to police. Instead, it has been one of our greatest weaknesses.
    Our country&#8217;s doors have been left unlocked. First the virus and then its
    mutations have been imported to our shores. The lesson is that failing to act
    quickly and decisively leads only to greater pain further down the line.</p><p
    pid="b752.1/10">From <phrase class="date" code="2021-01-01">1 January</phrase>
    to <phrase class="date" code="2021-03-23">23 March</phrase> last year, only 273
    people from four flights were formally quarantined, when over 18 million people
    entered the country by air. That came at a time when we all saw the terrible scenes
    in northern Italy of hospitals being overwhelmed, when our constituents were contacting
    us questioning why there were not better and more effective controls at our airports,
    and when our own chief scientific adviser to the Government said</p><p class="indent"
    pid="b752.1/11" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a lot of the cases in the UK did not
    come from China&#8221;</p><p pid="b752.1/12">and that they</p><p class="indent"
    pid="b752.1/13" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;came from European imports and the high
    level of travel into the UK&#8221;</p><p pid="b752.1/14">at that time.</p><p pid="b752.1/15">I
    wrote to the Home Secretary in April to ask her to learn the lessons from that,
    but still the UK remained an international outlier. In May 2020, the UK stood  with
    only Iran, Luxembourg and the US Virgin Islands in having no border protection
    measures in place. In that first national lockdown, 446,500 people&#8212;nearly
    half a million&#8212;arrived in the UK. It was not until <phrase class="date"
    code="2021-06-08">8 June</phrase> last year that formal quarantining was introduced.
    Even when border testing was made compulsory, which was only this month&#8212;10
    months after the first lockdown began&#8212;the Government still had to delay
    the implementation as they could not get the necessary systems in place. Where
    has the proper strategy on border testing been? This essential and vital strategy
    would have made such a difference.</p><p pid="b752.1/16">Rather than careful planning,
    we have experienced chaotic scenes at Heathrow, even in recent weeks. Covid is
    not going away. We need this strategy, and we need it now. The Government border
    policy has lurched from one crisis to another devoid of strategy, and we have
    seen that only in recent weeks with the announcement of the Government&#8217;s
    latest proposals on hotel quarantining. Limiting restrictions to just a small
    number of countries means that the protections do not go anywhere near far enough,
    with the threat of new variants coming in from other countries not on the red
    list. In the words of the Government&#8217;s chief scientific adviser, are they
    really going &#8220;hard, early and broader&#8221;? Absolutely not. Again, it
    is too little too late. Even when Ministers made the announcement, they had no
    date for bringing it into effect.</p><p pid="b752.1/17">Our vaccine roll-out is
    a source of great hope for the whole country, and great credit must go to our
    scientists and all those involved in the vaccine programme, but the biggest threat
    to the vaccine programme is from mutant strains of the virus. We know where some
    mutant strains have emerged because of the advanced genome sequencing that detected
    them, but too few countries have that expertise. We know the virus will mutate
    further, and we cannot risk one of those mutations undermining our vaccines. Back-Bench
    Conservative MPs who do not support this motion today are sending a message that
    they are willing to take that risk.</p><p pid="b752.1/18">The hard truth is that
    we have no certainty about where the next more dangerous strains of Covid will
    emerge. We have been warned that new strains are already potentially threatening
    vaccine efficacy, and yet we still have around 21,000 visitors entering the country
    daily. It will make no sense to people that Britain&#8217;s borders are still
    open while the country is locked down. That is why Labour is calling for decisive
    action today through a comprehensive hotel quarantine policy, and that would mean
    a policy of enforced quarantine restrictions on arrivals. Of course I accept that
    there would need to be exemptions, especially in areas such as haulage to keep
    the country functioning, but our starting point must be a comprehensive policy.
    Failing to adopt that policy risks undermining the huge gains that have been made
    by the vaccine roll-out, threatening life and hope.</p><p pid="b752.1/19">The
    existing quarantining system is not working. To see that, we have only to look
    at the Government&#8217;s own figures, which show that just three in every 100
    people have been successfully contacted for quarantine compliance &#8212;yet another
    Government failure. Other figures suggest that just one in 10 passenger locator
    forms is checked at airports. None of that is good enough, and it has happened
    because the Government have failed in their  duty to properly drive a consistent
    strategy and high performance through our measures at the border and the checks
    of the isolation assurance service.</p><p pid="b752.1/20">Yet those inadequate
    measures are still our protection against the virus for all but a limited number
    of countries on the red list. Devoid of strategy, the Government continue to be
    behind the curve, hoping for the best. It is little wonder that there seems to
    be such confusion and unedifying counter-briefing among the Cabinet on the policy,
    because frankly, it makes no sense. We do not even know at the moment when the
    policy will be introduced and whether the Government propose legislation for it,
    as has been speculated.</p><p pid="b752.1/21">I have great respect for the Minister,
    as she knows, and it is great to see her present for the debate, but I note that
    the Home Secretary is not participating in it to defend Government policy, which
    after all is part of her departmental responsibilities. Frankly, she has every
    reason not to be present, given that the Home Office has lost 400,000 police records
    and she still has not explained what has been lost, let alone how she will retrieve
    it. We also know what her personal view is of Government policy. There has been
    alleged briefing to newspapers that she does not agree with Government policy,
    but if there was any doubt about what her view was, we can all watch the video
    of her telling Conservative party members that she advocated for the borders to
    be closed back in March last year.</p><p pid="b752.1/22">We know that the Home
    Secretary does not support, and has not supported, the Government policy on the
    borders that she has had to defend in public, so who does support it? The Health
    Secretary, who was said to be opening the debate instead of her, is not present
    either. It is said that there have been briefings to newspapers that he is another
    Cabinet Minister who does not agree with the policy. Perhaps the Minister can
    outline and promise to publish the full scientific data that underpins the Government&#8217;s
    decision to create a so-called red list of countries, and set out not just the
    commencement date but what she envisages the exit strategy from the measures to
    be.</p><p pid="b752.1/23">How on earth can the Government be assured that the
    measures will prevent emerging strains from countries outside those on the red
    list? The truth is that the Government cannot answer that question. As a result,
    the policy is fatally flawed. A comprehensive quarantine policy would give us
    the best possible chance of preventing a new strain from undermining the astonishing
    collective sacrifice of the British people. It cannot be right that, with the
    ineffective quarantine system that is in place, 21,000 people continue to enter
    the country on a daily basis.</p><p pid="b752.1/24">I recognise, of course, the
    huge challenges to the aviation sector and its supply chains, the impact on the
    tourism and hospitality industry, and the number of jobs that it supports. I have
    heard about it in my own discussions over the past year, and when I have been
    able to visit our airport frontline. Let me also pay tribute to Border Force,
    the police and our wider law enforcement community. They have worked heroically,
    but the gaps in our defences that have existed and do exist are not their fault,
    but the failure of Ministers.</p><p pid="b752.1/25">That failure also extends
    to economic support. It is why the Government must come forward with the long-promised
    sector-specific support deal called for by my hon. Friend the shadow Transport
    Secretary, saving jobs  and ensuring that there are environmental improvements
    as set out in this motion. Let me be clear: we need to see this support package,
    and the money needs to be properly targeted to meet its aims. We have seen appalling
    fire and rehire tactics, which should be outlawed. That practice has no place
    in our country and it is an insult to workers. Staff salaries should be protected
    with a clear commitment to workers&#8217; rights, and let us see a commitment
    to cleaner fuels and other cutting-edge low or zero-emission technologies. Companies&#8217;
    tax bases should be in the UK, and there should not be dividends paid until a
    company is commercially viable. UK-based suppliers must be the priority, and operators
    must comply with consumer rights regulations. The Government have known the need
    for this for months, and inaction and continuing inaction is not the answer.</p><p
    pid="b752.1/26">As hon. and right hon. Members cast their votes today &#8212;indeed,
    whether or not they choose to cast votes at all&#8212;I ask them to think back
    and learn the lessons. If we had introduced quarantining for high-risk countries
    only a year ago, what would have happened? As one Scientific Advisory Group for
    Emergencies member, Sir Jeremy Farrar, put it:</p><p class="indent" pid="b752.1/27"
    pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;We need to learn the lessons from 2020&#8230;If we&#8217;d
    imposed restrictions in January and February last year we would probably have
    imposed them on high risk countries&#8212;China maybe. But almost all the virus
    that arrived came from Europe.&#8221;</p><p pid="b752.1/28">There is no point,
    either, in offering a false choice or a bogus dilemma between protective health
    measures at the border and the economy. Our best chance of breathing life back
    into the UK aviation and tourism industry is to be able to lift as many restrictions
    as possible here at home as soon as it is safe to do so with the vaccine roll-out.</p><p
    pid="b752.1/29">Crucially, that would all be put at risk if a new strain took
    hold that is resistant to the vaccine, yet the quarantine policy as it stands
    does precious little to stop that. It cannot predict where the next strains will
    emerge, and in its current form it cannot stop arrivals in the UK breaking quarantine
    rules. The existing quarantine system just is not effective. The Government have
    created an Achilles heel that undermines the heroic efforts of the British people
    in tackling this virus. Members across this House believe that as well&#8212;perhaps
    even members of the Cabinet. Now is the time to act. Lives will depend on it and
    our futures depend on it. I commend this motion to the House.</p>'

    moment in this country&#8217;s response to the coronavirus pandemic and our emergence
    from this crisis. When the Chancellor stands up to deliver his Budget, he faces
    a choice: he could take us back to the short-termist, irresponsible policies that
    left our economy and our country so dangerously exposed before the crisis hit,
    or he could learn from the mistakes made over the past 10 years and move forward,
    to a stronger, more prosperous future. Our economic recovery is at stake and the
    Chancellor cannot afford to get it wrong. He cannot continue to duck the big decisions,
    nor to go missing when he is most needed, and he must make the responsible choices
    that have been so frequently lacking over the past year.</p><p pid="b766.3/4">We
    cannot get away from the fact that our country has been hit harder than most during
    this crisis, and much harder than it needed to be. That is despite the herculean
    efforts of our NHS and social care, and other key workers; the incredible national
    commitment we have seen from those who have volunteered up and down our country;
    the ingenuity of our scientists; and the hard work and commitment of businesses
    and workers up and down the land. The UK was not fated to have the highest death
    toll from covid in Europe, nor to suffer the worst economic crisis of any major
    economy.</p><p pid="b766.3/5">Such grim statistics relate to decisions taken or
    not taken during the crisis, but also to 10 years when the foundations of our
    economy and our public services were weakened. The UK entered 2020 as one of the
    most unequal countries in Europe. Wages had flatlined for 10 long years&#8212;the
    worst decade for pay growth in generations. Yet as pay stagnated, childcare costs
    spiralled for families across the country. Household finances took such a hit
    that one in four families had less than &#163;100 of savings in the bank when
    the crisis hit. At the same time, the public services we all rely on had been
    stripped back and stockpiles of vital equipment had been run down, providing a
    worryingly low level of resilience.</p><p pid="b766.3/6">All this happened because
    the party opposite was not willing to take the responsible decisions required
    to set our country on stronger foundations. Instead, after the global financial
    crisis, Conservative-led Governments hammered family finances and withdrew funding
    for public services, in moves that have now been widely criticised not just by
    Labour, but by the likes of the International Monetary Fund and the OECD.</p>'

    and further calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make a monthly oral statement
    to Parliament updating the House on these matters.</p><p pid="b823.1/3">Today&#8217;s
    debate takes place almost a year after the first introduction of national lockdown
    restrictions due to the pandemic. We all know how trying events since then have
    been for families and businesses up and down our country, and now, thanks to the
    vaccine and the incredible work of NHS staff and volunteers, there is real hope
    that before long we can return to some semblance of normality. While there are
    grounds for optimism, however, we on the Labour Benches know that there are still
    deep worries among many businesses and working people about whether their firms
    and jobs will still be viable when the restrictions are lifted. So many people
    are concerned about whether they will have a job to return to, and millions of
    people who have gone for almost a year without support are questioning how they
    will manage to get by until our economy reopens.</p><p pid="b823.1/4">What people
    want and need right now is clarity. They need a sign that the Government get it,
    and that they understand and can respond to the needs of businesses and workers
    who have been placed under such incredible pressure through no fault of their
    own. The Prime Minister&#8217;s road map provides tentative suggestions about
    when businesses may be able to reopen, but we did not hear how the Government
    will be able to help to tide them over until that time. As with almost every major
    announcement throughout this crisis, we have had an update on the restrictions
    but no update on the economic support. It is not even clear whether the Chancellor
    believes that there is a relationship between restrictions and additional support,
    or whether he believes that businesses and workers should simply be grateful for
    what they have got. He may not be here today&#8212;it is becoming clear that accountability
    is very much not part of his brand&#8212;but we should be in no doubt about the
    harm that this approach has caused. Our country has endured the worst economic
    crisis of any major economy. Throughout the crisis, Ministers have made the same
    mistakes time and again and been forced to play catch-up at every turn, long after
    the problems with support have become apparent.</p><p pid="b823.1/5">Whether the
    Chancellor is being careless or negligent, his approach is the opposite of what
    businesses need, which is the provision of certainty and assurance so that they
    can plan ahead. Where issues exist, they expect Government action to address them;
    they do not expect problems to be dumped in the &#8220;too difficult&#8221; box.
    There are few more egregious examples of that than the Chancellor&#8217;s persistent
    failure to help the excluded&#8212;the people who fall into the gaps between Government
    schemes. These are people who have taken risks by starting their own businesses,
    or perhaps they were changing jobs, but through no fault of their own they have
    been denied support since the start of the pandemic.</p><p pid="b823.1/6">For
    many months, Labour has called on the Government to fix these problems. At first,
    Ministers said that it was not practical to do so, and of course we accept that
    in those fast-moving few weeks right at the start, that was fair enough, but now,
    almost a year on since the start of restrictions, how can this possibly be justified
    when the solutions are in plain sight? I repeat my call to the Minister today:
    when are the Government going to do what is right and fix the gaps in their support
    schemes? Labour recognises the value that self-employed workers bring to our economy.
    We want to see people taking risks, becoming entrepreneurs and helping to build
    the fairest possible recovery and a dynamic economy. That is why we would help
    those who are excluded from support by extending eligibility for the self-employed
    income support scheme to anyone with a 2019-20 tax return, and it is why we are
    asking the Government today to confirm that the fourth self-employed income support
    scheme grant will be paid at 80% of pre-crisis profits.</p>'

    and pick up on some contributions that hon. Members have made. My hon. Friend
    the Member for Luton North (Sarah Owen) made powerful remarks and drew our attention
    to how hollow the phrase of the former Prime Minister—that “sunlight is the best
    disinfectant”—now rings, given how the current Government have behaved. My hon.
    Friend the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) spoke from great
    experience about the weakness of Parliament in scrutinising Government spending.
    She set out how the claims of bureaucracy from Government Members are misplaced
    and that, in fact, new clause 1 is about transparency and accountability. My hon.
    Friend the Member for Warrington North (Charlotte Nichols) set out clearly the
    consequences of vast sums being given to companies with no track record of delivery,
    underscoring why this really matters to people’s lives.

    The press may not report it, but women of all backgrounds, from all parts of the

    crime are being  asked to wait up to four years to get to court. Many witnesses

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="e189.3/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read
    a Second time.</p><p pid="e189.3/2">As you will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the
    scrutiny of Finance Bills has lain at the centre of our parliamentary process
    for many centuries, ever since its origins in the 13th century, and it is a rare
    honour for me to bring this Bill forward today.</p><p pid="e189.3/3">At the beginning
    of last month, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer outlined a
    Budget with three key objectives: first, to protect jobs and livelihoods and provide
    additional support to get the British people and British businesses through the
    pandemic; secondly, to be clear about the need to fix the public finances once
    we are on the way to recovery and to start that work; thirdly, as we emerge from
    the pandemic, to lay the groundwork for a robust and resilient future economy.
    This Finance Bill enacts changes to taxation that support all those objectives.</p><p
    pid="e189.3/4">I will come to the Bill itself shortly, but before I do so I want
    to pay tribute again to the work of the Treasury and Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue
    and Customs over the past year and more. I can testify from personal experience
    that officials have worked around the clock throughout that period to get the
    covid schemes up and running, to make sure that they are as effective as possible,
    to tweak and extend them where they can and, by those means, to support millions
    of people and hundreds of thousands of businesses up and down the United Kingdom
    in the face of the worst peacetime economic crisis in recorded history. I will
    not say that this was their finest hour; they will have had many of those, as
    these are institutions that are arguably nigh on 500 years old. None the less,
    this has certainly been a time to which future historians will look back when
    they seek examples of exemplary public service.</p><p pid="e189.3/5">It has been
    a privilege to work alongside officials at both Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury and
    Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, and to see the great machinery of government
    working so well. I will, if I may, add one other word of scene-setting about the
    wider approach that we have taken to tax. It is a measure of the approach taken
    by the Treasury and HMRC and of our own strategic approach as a Government that,
    alongside these pandemic measures, we have also accelerated work to create a more
    effective and resilient tax system. Our goal, in simple terms, is to enhance the
    stability and effectiveness of the UK tax system, using last year&#8217;s announcement
    of a new 10-year tax administration strategy as the springboard.</p><p pid="e189.3/6">We
    want a tax system that enhances productivity, especially across the long tail
    of our small and medium-sized businesses. Digitisation of the tax system provides
    a useful nudge to these firms to upgrade their use of information technology and
    the skills that it demands.  We want a tax system that is more flexible, so that
    it is better able to adapt quickly to changing circumstances and to provide targeted
    support for businesses and individuals when needed. We want a tax system that
    is more resilient&#8212;both resilient itself and better equipped to strengthen
    the core resilience of the UK economy in the face of a future crisis. That transformation
    of our tax system is already under way, but, as the House will know, we have also
    taken steps to improve the process of tax policy development, most recently with
    the tax policies and consultations day we held on <phrase class="date" code="2021-03-23">23
    March</phrase>. By giving this wide array of consultations more profile, we hope
    to make the tax policy process still more collaborative and transparent and improve
    the quality of tax policy making.</p><p pid="e189.3/7">Let me turn to the Bill.
    The House is well aware of the massive public health and economic shock that this
    country has experienced. The damage done by coronavirus to our economy and our
    society has been severe. More than 700,000 people have lost their jobs since March
    last year. The economy has shrunk by 10%, the largest fall in more than 300 years,
    and this country&#8217;s borrowing is the highest it has ever been outside wartime.</p><p
    pid="e189.3/8">The Government&#8217;s response has been comprehensive and sustained,
    with the total package of support to the economy this year and next now estimated
    at &#163;407 billion. That response is already showing its value. Thanks to that
    and to the rapid roll-out of vaccination, the Office for Budget Responsibility
    and other independent authorities now expect a swifter recovery than previously
    anticipated, with faster growth, lower unemployment, more investment and higher
    household incomes. Indeed, the OBR expects the UK economy to recover to its pre-crisis
    levels six months earlier than it did&#8212;in the second rather than the fourth
    quarter of 2022. In the words of the Resolution Foundation, if realised, this
    projected rate of unemployment,</p><p class="indent" pid="e189.3/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;would
    be by far the lowest unemployment peak in any recent recession, despite this being
    the deepest downturn for 300 years.&#8221;</p><p pid="e189.3/10">At the heart
    of our covid response is precisely that support for jobs, delivered through Her
    Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs as the tax authority, with more than 11 million
    jobs furloughed between the beginning of the pandemic in March last year and February
    of this year. As the OBR outlined last month, without the additional measures
    at Budget, which included the extension of the coronavirus job retention scheme,
    unemployment would have peaked two quarters earlier and at a higher level. Indeed,
    it estimates that there would have been an additional 300,000 unemployed people
    in the fourth quarter of this year without these latest interventions.</p><p pid="e189.3/11">The
    tax measures outlined in the Bill go further now to protect jobs and support the
    economy. We are extending the 5% reduced VAT rate until <phrase class="date" code="2021-09-30">30
    September</phrase> in order to protect 150,000 hard-hit hospitality and tourism
    businesses, which employ almost 2.5 million people. To help those businesses manage
    the transition back to the standard rate, VAT will then increase to an interim
    rate of 12.5% from October until the end of March.</p><p pid="e189.3/12">For similar
    reasons, the Bill puts into legislation the temporary cut in stamp duty land tax
    with a residential SDLT nil rate band remaining at &#163;500,000 in England and
    Northern Ireland until the end of June. This, again, will be followed by a phased
    transition back to the normal rate. From <phrase class="date" code="2021-07-01">1
    July</phrase> 2021, it will fall to &#163;250,000 until the end of September,
    before returning to &#163;125,000 on <phrase class="date" code="2021-10-01">1
    October</phrase>.</p><p pid="e189.3/13">For any business that took advantage of
    the original VAT deferral new payments scheme, the Bill ensures that they will
    be able to pay that deferred VAT in up to 11 equal payments from March 2021, rather
    than by one larger payment due by <phrase class="date" code="2021-03-31">31 March</phrase>
    2021. For those businesses that have been pushed into losses, the trading loss
    carry-back rule is being extended from the existing one year to three years for
    losses of up to &#163;2 million, which will deliver a significant cash-flow benefit
    for businesses.</p><p pid="e189.3/14">As well as protecting jobs and livelihoods,
    the Bill takes important steps to strengthen the public finances. The damage done
    by coronavirus and the urgent need to respond to the crisis have created huge
    challenges for the Exchequer. The OBR&#8217;s fiscal forecasts show that this
    year the UK is expected to borrow a record amount: &#163;355 billion. That is
    17% of our national income&#8212;the highest level of borrowing since world war
    two. Borrowing is forecast to be &#163;234 billion next year, which is 10.3% of
    GDP&#8212;an amount so large that it has only one rival in recent history, which
    is the level of borrowing this year.</p><p pid="e189.3/15">It is our responsibility
    as a Government to balance the extraordinary support we are providing to the economy
    now with the need to start to fix the public finances, and the Bill strikes that
    balance.</p><p pid="e189.3/16">First, the income tax personal allowance rises
    with the consumer prices index as planned to &#163;12,570 from this month and
    will then be maintained at this level until April 2026. The House will recall
    that the UK has the highest basic personal tax allowance of any G20 country. A
    typical basic rate taxpayer now pays over &#163;1,200 less in tax than in 2010.
    The higher rate threshold also rises to &#163;50,270 from this month and will
    then be maintained at this level until April 2026. These changes are fair and
    progressive. It is important to note that the 20% highest income households will
    contribute 15 times that of the 20% lowest income households. An average basic
    rate taxpayer will be less than a pound a week worse off in 2022-23.</p><p pid="e189.3/17">Secondly,
    the inheritance tax thresholds, the pensions lifetime allowance and the annual
    exempt amount in capital gains tax will also be maintained at their 2020-21 levels
    until April 2026. Maintaining the pensions lifetime allowance at current levels
    affects only those with the largest pensions&#8212;those worth more than &#163;1
    million.</p><p pid="e189.3/18">Thirdly, the Government are providing businesses
    with over &#163;100 billion of support to get through this pandemic, so our judgment
    has been that it is only fair to ask them to contribute to this overall recovery.
    The Bill therefore legislates for the rate of corporation tax paid on company
    profits to increase to 25% from 2023. Since corporation tax is charged only on
    company profits, businesses that may be struggling will, by definition, be unaffected.</p><p
    pid="e189.3/19">The Government are also protecting small businesses with profits
    of &#163;50,000 or less by creating a small profits rate, maintained at the current
    rate of 19%. The effect of this is that 70% of companies, or 1.4 million businesses,
    will not see an increase in their tax rate. There is also a taper above &#163;50,000
    so that only businesses with profits of a quarter of a million pounds or greater
    will be taxed at the full 25% rate&#8212;and that is itself still the lowest corporation
    tax rate in the G7. The increase is two years away, well after the point when
    the OBR expects the economy to have recovered, but it is important to legislate
    for this now in order to give businesses clarity about our future plans.</p><p
    pid="e189.3/20">The next goal of this Budget has been to lay the foundations of
    our future economy as we emerge from the pandemic. If that economy is to support
    the creation of new jobs, to spur growth and to drive productivity forward, we
    need to encourage business investment now, so this Bill contains a highly innovative
    new super deduction measure, which is expected to lift the net present value of
    the UK&#8217;s plant and machinery allowances from 30th among the countries of
    the OECD to first.</p><p pid="e189.3/21">In most cases, this measure will allow
    companies to reduce their taxable profits by 130% of the cost of investment they
    make, equivalent to a tax cut of up to 25p for every pound they invest. The super
    deduction is expected to be worth &#163;25 billion during the two years it is
    in place, which would make it the biggest business tax cut in modern British history.
    The OBR has said that, at its peak in the financial year 2022-23, the super deduction
    is expected to bring forward an additional 10% of business investment, with a
    value of &#163;20 billion.</p><p pid="e189.3/22">Alongside a programme of national
    recovery, we also want to stimulate regional recovery. That is why this Bill also
    enables the Government to designate tax sites for freeports in Great Britain.
    Once approved, eligible businesses will be able to benefit from a number of tax
    reliefs, including an enhanced 10% rate of structures and buildings allowance,
    an enhanced capital allowance of 100% for companies investing in plant and machinery,
    and full relief from stamp duty land tax on the purchase of land or property&#8212;and
    to help them to invest and grow, the Bill maintains the annual investment allowance
    at the higher level of &#163;1 million until the end of this year.</p><p pid="e189.3/23">The
    House will also recall that these measures are supplemented by the Budget&#8217;s
    new Help to Grow: Digital scheme, which will assist smaller businesses in developing
    their digital skills by giving them free expert training and a 50% discount on
    new productivity-enhancing software. This is all part of a package that the Institute
    of Directors has called</p><p class="indent" pid="e189.3/24" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a

    a pay rise for 2021/22 below 2.1%; to require the Secretary of State to move a
    motion in the House of Commons to approve any such report; and for connected purposes.</p><p
    pid="a321.2/3">The last 13 months have impacted all of our lives, through illness,
    bereavement and financial worries, on top of learning to live with the fear of
    the pandemic and the limits on our freedoms. We have not all faced the same level
    of difficulties, but none of us have escaped without our lives in some way being
    changed by the experience. Some 127,000 people have tragically lost their lives&#8212;this
    is one of the highest death tolls in Europe &#8212;and in the past year more than
    450,000 have been hospitalised due to severe covid symptoms.</p><p pid="a321.2/4">For
    every one of those people, it has been our amazing NHS frontline staff who have
    cared for them, fought for them and either celebrated their recovery or held their
    hand as they took their last breath. Our NHS staff have kept this country going,
    risking their own health, isolating from their own families, working harder than
    ever, grieving the lives they could not save and comforting the bereaved. They
    are the very best of Britain and they deserve to be given the credit and the reward
    for everything that they have done and everything they have sacrificed to keep
    the rest of us safe.</p><p pid="a321.2/5">Nurses and NHS staff were promised at
    least a 2.1% pay rise, but the Government have now retracted that and recommended
    1% for all NHS staff, with the exception of junior doctors, GPs and dentists.
    The Government pretend that this is a rise, but they are fooling no one. With
    inflation forecast to reach 1.7% this year, our NHS staff, who have shown nothing
    but commitment this last year, are now set to receive a real-terms pay cut. Nurses&#8217;
    pay has been falling in real terms since the Conservatives came to power 11 years
    ago, with pay awards consistently lagging behind inflation. Already that is unacceptable,
    but in the current situation the Government&#8217;s proposal to reduce that even
    further shows a complete lack of respect and gratitude.</p><p pid="a321.2/6">For
    me, the thought of looking a nurse in the eye and telling them that they are worth
    less this year than they were before the pandemic is outrageously insulting. All
    of us across this House stood on our doorsteps and clapped for our key workers.
    We all took to social media to thank NHS staff and tell them what a wonderful
    job they were doing. We would have all been indebted to them if we had got sick
    and needed hospital care to help us against this undiscriminating virus, as some
    on these Benches indeed did. So was this just for show? Were the warm words and
    platitudes just a tick-box exercise? Or do the Prime Minister and his Government,
    hand on heart, truly believe that a rule-breaking, unapologetic aide is worth
    considerably more than the hundreds of thousands of NHS staff who have worked
    tirelessly and selflessly to battle this viral enemy and save lives?</p><p pid="a321.2/7">The
    promise was clear: a 2.1% increase, as a minimum&#8212;it was not dependent on
    inflation rates or any other economic struggles. That promise has been broken,
    in  yet another ill-judged U-turn by the Government. If the Prime Minister and
    his Cabinet colleagues have now rescinded that offer and replaced it with an inferior
    one, they need to come to this House with the revised recommendation and put it
    to a vote. When Opposition Members clapped on a Thursday evening and pledged our
    support to the NHS heroes, we meant it, and we still mean it. Those NHS staff
    have held up their side of the bargain, working diligently and doing everything
    in their power to save lives. Now it is our turn to hold up our side by voting
    in favour of a fair, long-term pay deal that reflects their commitment.</p><p
    pid="a321.2/8">A recent survey by the Royal College of Nursing concluded that
    more than a third of the 42,000 people who submitted responses were considering
    leaving the NHS because they felt undervalued. These are staff who are exhausted
    from their efforts over the last year&#8212;they have worked unpaid overtime,
    forfeited their mental wellbeing and, far too often, put our families ahead of
    their own. The least they expected in return was recognition and fairness, but
    when it comes to a Government who have consistently failed to deliver on both,
    it appears that they were expecting too much.</p><p pid="a321.2/9">We are on a
    cliff edge here: we already know that we entered the pandemic with a record 100,000
    vacancies across the NHS. If we do not pay the staff what they deserve, we will
    struggle to retain those we have&#8212;let alone fill any vacancies. Even the
    2.1% in the long-term plan was a minimum, and a cautious one at that, but 1% is
    not a pay rise&#8212;it is an insult. Trade unions and professional bodies are
    calling for improved pay offers at varying levels. They know that a fair pay rise
    would also help to boost staff recruitment and retention.</p><p pid="a321.2/10">A
    1% pay rise for an experienced nurse equates to &#163;3.50 a week. That is &#163;3.50
    for a year of unpaid overtime, unwavering commitment and personal sacrifice&#8212;&#163;3.50
    for a year of turmoil; of fighting a virus that at times seemed unbeatable; of
    watching patients die, despite doing everything possible to save them; and of
    having to keep on going when beyond exhausted.</p><p pid="a321.2/11">On the Opposition
    side of the House, we believe  that our NHS is worth so much more. Under this  Bill,
    the Government will be required to present their recommendations for anything
    below the already approved minimum increase of 2.1%, and to seek agreement from
    the House on any new proposals. That is the least that our NHS deserves. Our NHS
    staff have not faltered since the start of the pandemic, and they deserve to be
    rewarded for that. Unions and stakeholders know it, the public know it and we
    on this side of the House know it.</p><p pid="a321.2/12">Question put (<phrase

    pid="a325.2/24">That is how former Prime Minister David Cameron described the
    next big scandal to hit British politics, back in 2010. We might think that what
    David Cameron lacks in transparency he makes up for in fortune telling, except
    that he had inside information because the person exploiting the loopholes would
    be the very same David Cameron.</p><p pid="a325.2/25">We had a Conservative Prime
    Minister giving Lex Greensill access to all areas of Government. He was brought
    in and given privileged access to the heart of Government with the title and the
    business card of a senior adviser in the Prime Minister&#8217;s office. Then&#8212;what
    a stroke of luck&#8212;when he was no longer Prime Minister, and just past the
    required period, when he no longer needed the approval of the Advisory Committee
    on Business Appointments, David Cameron joined Greensill to lobby the Conservative
    Government full of his friends.</p><p pid="a325.2/26">Having refused to respond
    to any questions at all for 40 days, David Cameron chose a period of national
    grief, hoping that there would be less political criticism and less scrutiny.
    It is cynical and it is shabby, and the statement itself was toe-curling. He is
    not sorry for his conduct, for the texts and the drinks, but he is sorry he got
    caught and he is sorry that his shares are now worthless. This is not just a question
    of why he did not go through the correct channels; it is question of why he was
    doing this at all.</p><p pid="a325.2/27">Let us be really clear: David Cameron
    was not working in the national interest; he was working in his own personal interest,
    with the hope of making millions of pounds for himself through the exercise of
    his share options. But questions cannot just be asked of David Cameron, when it
    is current Conservative Ministers who have paved the way for this scandal. When
    it comes to lobbying, it takes two to tango. For every former Minister lobbying,
    there is someone in power being lobbied. That is why this scandal is not just
    about the conduct of David Cameron during his time as Prime Minister and in the
    years afterwards. This is about who he lobbied in the current Government and how
    they responded.</p><p pid="a325.2/28">Lex Greensill was awarded a CBE and was
    made a Crown representative by a Conservative Government, yet his company&#8217;s
    spectacular collapse now means that over 50,000 jobs are at risk around the world,
    including thousands in the UK&#8217;s steel communities, from Hartlepool to Stocksbridge,
    from Rotherham to Scunthorpe and to Newport. The steel industry is crucial and
    the Government must make it clear that our steel industry will not pay the price
    for the failures at Greensill and beyond.</p><p pid="a325.2/29">This Government
    have set up an inquiry, but just about supply chain finance and Greensill. Such
    a review is wholly inadequate, and deliberately so. They do not want to explore
    what needs to change in lobbying or who currently gets access to power, or the
    wider issue of how to lift standards, which have fallen so far in the 10 years
    of Conservative Governments. They do not want public hearings. They do not want
    the disinfectant of sunlight, as David Cameron once urged. They just want this
    to go away, which is why they have chosen Nigel Boardman to chair the inquiry.</p><p
    pid="a325.2/30">It is a fact that Nigel Boardman is a good friend&#8212;a very
    good friend&#8212;of the Conservative Government. Some may suspect that the son
    of a former Conservative Cabinet Minister might be unlikely to make waves, but
    let us look at his record. Mr Boardman has been paid over &#163;20,000 per year
    as a non-executive director at the  Department for Business, Energy and Industrial
    Strategy&#8212;a Department with a real interest in the British Business Bank,
    which lent to Greensill, and the British steel industry, where so many jobs are
    now at risk. Mr Boardman has already whitewashed the Government&#8217;s handling
    of public procurement during the pandemic and I fear that he will do the same
    again with this inquiry.</p><p pid="a325.2/31">You will remember, Mr Speaker,
    that I jointly chaired the inquiry into the collapse of Carillion. The fact that
    Mr Boardman&#8217;s law firm made &#163;8 million advising Carillion, including
    &#163;1 million on the day before the outsourcers collapsed, leaves a terrible
    taste in my mouth as it should in the mouths of Members on the Government Benches.
    To cap it all, Mr Boardman was appointed to a prestigious role at the British
    Museum by&#8212;oh, by David Cameron! What is being proposed by the Government
    is not remotely fit for purpose. It is not an inquiry. It is not independent.
    It is an insult to us all.</p><p pid="a325.2/32">The scope of this inquiry has
    to be bigger than supply chain financing. It has to be about lobbying, too, and
    bigger than what rules were broken. If the existing lobbying rules were not breached,
    that is a big part of the problem, surely. Had the Conservatives backed Labour&#8217;s
    amendments to the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union
    Administration Bill back in 2014, there would have been much more transparency,
    but they did not. David Cameron and his Government voted them down, and boy are
    they exploiting them now! We need public service in the national interest, not
    people viewing the state like some get-rich-quick scheme, with taxpayers treated
    as collateral damage.</p><p pid="a325.2/33">We now learn that the Conservatives
    are joined in all this by the SNP, whose Rural Economy Secretary in the Scottish
    Government dined with Lex Greensill in one of Glasgow&#8217;s finest restaurants
    with no officials, no notes, no emails, no texts and no phone records about the
    meeting. Here in Westminster, we have witnessed the degrading of the ministerial
    code.</p>'

    pwmotiontext="yes">That this House disagrees with Lords amendment 4L.</p><p pid="c392.3/3">As
    I have said on a number of occasions at this Dispatch Box, I want to express my
    sincere thanks once again to all right hon. and hon. Members for engaging in this
    important debate. I would like to repeat the message given by my noble Friend
    the building safety Minister in paying tribute to the fire and rescue services
    across our country, because in recent days we have seen large fires in Greater
    Manchester and Shropshire, and they have been dealt with in an exemplary and professional
    manner. This is a reminder of why we want to get this Bill on to the statute book&#8212;to
    help fire and rescue services do their job to ensure that buildings are properly
    and thoroughly assessed.</p><p pid="c392.3/4">All of us in this House and in the
    other place agree in the strongest terms that residents have the right to be and
    to feel safe in their homes. This Government remain steadfast in our commitment
    to delivering the Grenfell Tower inquiry phase 1 report&#8217;s recommendations.
    The Fire Safety Bill is an important first step in our legislative programme delivering
    these recommendations. I cannot stress enough, as I have reiterated on a number
    of occasions throughout the passage of this Bill, the vital importance of this
    legislation and the ramifications if it fails as a result of outstanding remediation
    amendments, and that is why I move that this House disagrees with Lords amendment
    4L.</p><p pid="c392.3/5">Without the Fire Safety Bill, legal ambiguity around
    the fire safety order will continue. Moreover, the updating of fire risk assessments
    to cover structure, external walls and flat entrance doors will be ignored by
    a number of negligent building owners, and fire and rescue services will lack
    the legal certainty to support enforcement decisions. That is a matter that I
    know will be in the minds of Members today, as it should also be in the minds
    of Members of the other place.</p><p pid="c392.3/6">A number of Members across
    the House have said to me, &#8220;Well, why not simply redraft the Bill?&#8221;
    That might be easier to do with other legislation that already has careful cross-referencing
    to other Acts and already has detailed secondary legislation to revise regulations,
    but not so with this small but none the less important Bill. Redrafting it, even
    if the amendments were not defective, so that it carefully navigates the intricate
    web of contract law and does not fall foul of such Acts beloved of Members of
    this House, including many Opposition Members, such as the Human Rights Act 1998,
    will take considerable time, and we do not have that time.</p><p pid="c392.3/7">Following
    our announcement in February, I am pleased to say that hundreds of thousands of
    leaseholders will be protected from the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on their
    homes as part of our five-point plan to end the cladding scandal once and for
    all, improve the saleability  of properties and restore confidence in the housing
    market. The measures that we announced in February&#8212;including our work with
    the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to reduce the need for EWS1 forms;
    our work with developers to put more of their own money on the table, additional
    to our tax and levy plans; and our work with lenders to buy into our package of
    measures to ensure sensible and proportionate value is re-ascribed to homes valued
    at zero&#8212;will allow hundreds of thousands of homes to be sold, bought or
    remortgaged once again. That will provide certainty to residents and lenders,
    boost the housing market and reinstate the value of properties. All the amendments
    we have received, debated and already disposed of would simply reignite uncertainty
    in the market and risk lenders once again turning to leaseholders saying, &#8220;Computer
    says no: we can&#8217;t value your property&#8221;.</p><p pid="c392.3/8">I find
    it somewhat ironic that Members are flagging these issues in the context of trying
    to impede the progress of the Bill, as having an up-to-date fire and risk assessment
    that considers the external wall system of a building should enable an insurer
    to take an informed and proportionate approach to risk that considers not only
    the material and construction of the building but the way in which it is managed.</p><p
    pid="c392.3/9">I agree that leaseholders need stronger avenues for redress. The
    draft Building Safety Bill, which has already gone through prelegislative scrutiny,
    will bring forward measures to do this, including making directors, as well as
    companies, liable for prosecution.</p><p pid="c392.3/10">I agree that the industry
    must also play its part. As I said to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Liam Fox" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10213">the Member for North
    Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>, who is in his place, our high-rise levy and developer
    tax will make sure that the developers with the broadest shoulders pay their way.
    I reiterate what I said to him yesterday about forfeiture, which is a draconian
    measure that should be used only as a last resort. We believe this matter should
    be considered as part of our wider programme of leasehold reform, which we have
    already indicated we will bring forward.</p><p pid="c392.3/11">I also welcome
    my right hon. Friend&#8217;s suggestion, in yesterday&#8217;s speech, about the
    case study from Portishead in his constituency. As I agreed yesterday, I think
    we can make good use of this opportunity to assess in-depth lessons learned from
    the systems on the ground. Again, I am grateful to him for his proposals.</p><p
    pid="c392.3/12">The safety of leaseholders and residents will be compromised if
    we do not ensure that this Bill is placed on the statute book by the end of this
    Session. We will not help leaseholders, nor will we make homes any safer, by impeding
    its passage.</p><p pid="c392.3/13">Lords amendment 4L lacks clarity, just like
    the others. Just like the others, it prohibits all kinds of remediation costs
    from being passed on to leaseholders, which means that were there to be even minor
    costs as a result of wear and tear, or even where leaseholders themselves are
    responsible for the damage, they would not be expected to pay. I do not believe,
    and I do not believe this House believes, that that is a proportionate response.</p>'

    February</phrase> 2021, a copy of which was laid before this House on <phrase
    class="date" code="2021-02-25">25 February</phrase> 2021, be revoked.</p><p pid="c429.1/3">On
    behalf of my party, let me say that it is entirely right that we have the opportunity
    to debate in the House of Commons the incredibly serious changes proposed in this
    motion. Quite frankly, it is remarkable that the Government sought to introduce
    these changes as a negative statutory instrument&#8212;through the back door without
    any opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny at all.</p><p pid="c429.1/4">This statutory
    instrument will remove protections in the Modern Slavery Act 2015 that sought
    to prevent potential victims of trafficking from being held unnecessarily in immigration
    detention. The changes are due to come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2021-05-25">25
    May</phrase>, following an extremely limited consultation with a select few groups,
    which had just two weeks to respond.</p><p pid="c429.1/5">The consultation, which
    did not seek to engage with any trafficking survivor groups, was described as
    &#8220;poor practice&#8221; by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. Given
    that the changes are being made alongside those outlined in the Government&#8217;s
    new plan for immigration, published last month, we are gravely concerned by the
    Government&#8217;s desire to erode the rights and protections for victims of some
    of the most heinous examples of exploitation.</p><p pid="c429.1/6">To be clear,
    the proposals will amend the adults at risk in immigration detention statutory
    guidance by removing paragraph 18 on trafficking cases. That means that, from
    <phrase class="date" code="2021-05-25">25 May</phrase>, decisions about the detention
    of potential victims of human trafficking will be made without reference to the
    Modern Slavery Act 2015 guidance, which made it clear that potential victims of
    trafficking are automatically considered unsuitable for detention unless there
    are public order reasons that militate against that. As a result, a decision will
    now be assessed within the much broader adults at risk framework, which considers
    a range of vulnerabilities, with the latest figure suggesting that about 39% of
    those detained in immigration detention are considered adults at risk.</p><p pid="c429.1/7">A
    range of immigration factors is considered as part of the decision-making process
    and those factors go far wider than public order. They can include a history of
    offending, but additionally whether the person&#8217;s immigration history includes
    having entered the country irregularly, not having claimed asylum immediately,
    or having failed to comply with Home Office reporting requirements.</p><p pid="c429.1/8">Often,
    having been a victim of trafficking leaves such individuals unable to satisfy
    those requirements. Being subject to coercive control commonly results in an individual
    entering the country outside approved routes or being unable to claim asylum immediately.
    Furthermore, to benefit from a stronger protection against detention once brought
    under the adults at risk guidance, potential victims of trafficking with a positive
    initial reasonable-grounds decision will now need to provide additional professional
    evidence demonstrating not only that they are an adult at risk, but that detention
    is likely to cause them harm. Therefore, the primary impact of the changes will
    be that potential victims of trafficking are detained,  and detained for longer.
    That is the view not only of the Opposition and various specialist stakeholders,
    but of the Government.</p><p pid="c429.1/9">In response to concerns raised, the
    Home Office admitted that some individuals might, as a result of the changes,
    be more likely to be detained or have their detention continued. Why, therefore,
    do the Government continue to press ahead when they are well aware of the damage
    and distress that will cause, particularly considering that they seek to deliver
    the changes through a statutory instrument considered under the negative procedure&#8212;deeming
    them unworthy of debate and scrutiny?</p><p pid="c429.1/10">I thank <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Richard Fuller" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24787">the hon. Member
    for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)</phrase>, who secured a Westminster
    Hall debate on this very issue just yesterday. That demonstrates that there are
    serious concerns about the proposals across the House. I listened carefully to
    the Minister&#8217;s response to the debate, and it seems that the Government
    seek to justify the changes by saying that a similar protection will be provided
    through casework guidance and training, which we have not yet seen and can only
    trust will be published in due course.</p><p pid="c429.1/11">We also expect that
    changes will be made to the caseworker guidance, such as the increase in requirements
    for medical evidence, which will further weaken the protections for victims of
    trafficking. For example, there are plans to introduce quality standards for external
    medical evidence in the adults at risk policy, including proposals to limit the
    weight of remote assessment, and a stipulation that healthcare professionals should
    have all the immigration documents and medical records relating to conditions,
    which a potential victim might not be comfortable disclosing or be able to disclose.</p><p
    pid="c429.1/12">Yesterday, the Minister emphasised his pride at this country&#8217;s
    leading role in identifying and protecting victims of modern slavery, but he also
    stressed that a rebalancing is required&#8212;if I have understood correctly&#8212;between
    protections for victims and immigration controls. He identified what he said is,
    by design, an &#8220;extremely low threshold&#8221; for a reasonable-grounds modern
    slavery decision whereby there is a requirement only to suspect, rather than to
    prove, someone is a potential victim of trafficking, and explained that the Government
    are looking to make adjustments to that, as set out in the new plan for immigration.</p><p
    pid="c429.1/13">I am sorry to say that all that is delivering a downgrading of
    those protections, which we could have been proud of. That is an erosion of existing
    safeguards and it will undoubtedly increase the risk of vulnerable individuals
    being retraumatised in detention.</p><p pid="c429.1/14">We are concerned not only
    by the implications of this statutory instrument but by the way in which the Government
    have sought to circumvent good practice and due diligence in their processes.
    The consultation period lasted just two weeks during the summer of last year,
    without the presence of specialist stakeholders and organisations. The Secondary
    Legislation Scrutiny Committee has aptly described the consultation as &#8220;poor
    practice&#8221;. Shockingly, the Government did not consult the Independent Anti-Slavery
    Commissioner or her office on these proposals. I very much hope that the Minister
    has read Dame Sara Thornton&#8217;s letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2021-04-19">19
    April</phrase> outlining a range of issues with the proposals.</p><p pid="c429.1/15">As
    many will already be aware, survivors of modern slavery are at increased risk
    of long-term depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide attempts  and
    health complications. Last week, the Royal College of Psychiatrists published
    a statement saying that it believes that detention centres are likely to precipitate
    a significant deterioration in mental health in most cases, greatly increasing
    both the suffering of the individual and the risk of suicide and self-harm. In
    2017 the Government promised a scheme called Places of Safety to allow survivors
    to access their rights soon after being identified in settings such as police
    raids or labour inspections. That would have given survivors an opportunity to
    access legal representation and advocacy while at their most vulnerable, as well
    as increasing the number of successful trafficking referrals to decision makers.
    Sadly, the Places of Safety scheme was never delivered, and as a result thousands
    of suspected slavery survivors were identified but never referred for support
    or decision making. I would very much like to know what has happened to that scheme,
    so will the Minister clarify that? An additional concern is the Government&#8217;s
    decision to cancel the pilot schemes exploring community alternatives to detention.
    I hope the Minister can also give some clarity to that crazy decision.</p><p pid="c429.1/16">These
    changes represent a significant downgrading of the protections against detention
    currently given to potential victims of human trafficking. The Government say
    they want to introduce this statutory instrument so that the adults at risk policy
    can be used as the single mechanism for vulnerable individuals, in order to clamp
    down on the policy anomaly that currently exists. To perceive such legislative
    change purely in terms of fixing a policy anomaly fails to acknowledge the devastating
    impact it will have on vulnerable victims and represents this Government&#8217;s
    concerning approach to wider immigration policy.</p><p pid="c429.1/17">The Government
    have previously stressed that a reduction in the number of people in detention
    is a key aspect of the series of reforms they are making across the detention
    system, yet this statutory instrument will achieve the exact opposite. Regrettably,
    it represents the Government&#8217;s failure to offer a solution that is compassionate,
    fair and deserving of vulnerable victims of human trafficking.</p>

  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b473.0/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
    Third time.</p><p pid="b473.0/2">Of course, for this Bill, it is the third time
    in more ways than one. Hon. Members will recall that a similar Bill was introduced
    in the last Parliament, and this Bill itself started in the last Session. I thank
    right hon. and hon. Members across the House, particularly the members of the
    Public Bill Committee for their scrutiny and all those involved in the previous
    iteration of the Bill during the last Parliament. I pay special tribute to the
    Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend
    <phrase class="honfriend" name="Rebecca Pow" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25407">the
    Member for Taunton Deane (Rebecca Pow)</phrase>, for her tireless work on the
    Bill, and to all the DEFRA officials for all the work they  put in to get such
    a significant piece of legislation to this point. It is a large and complex piece
    of legislation, and a huge amount of work has gone into getting its provisions
    right.</p><p pid="b473.0/3">Members in all parts of the House agree that the decline
    of our natural environment has persisted for too long. As we emerge from the covid-19
    pandemic, we must turn our attention to recovery. We must build back greener.
    The pandemic has reminded us all of the difference that nature makes to our lives.</p><p
    pid="b473.0/4">After G7 nations gather in Cornwall next month, the wider international
    community will attend the convention on biological diversity in Kunming in October,
    before the UK, as co-president, hosts the world at COP26 on climate change in
    November. This is a very important year for the environment internationally, and
    this landmark Environment Bill will deliver on our manifesto commitment to create
    the most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth.</p><p pid="b473.0/5">As
    I announced last week, the Government intend to amend the Bill in the other place
    to include a new, historic, legally binding target on species abundance for 2030,
    aiming to halt the decline of nature. This is a pioneering measure that will be
    the net zero equivalent for nature, spurring action on the scale required to address
    the biodiversity crisis. Our forthcoming Green Paper will also explore how we
    might deliver our world-leading domestic ambitions for nature, including how we
    improve the status of native species, such as the water vole and the red squirrel,
    and protect 30% of our land by 2030.</p><p pid="b473.0/6">My right hon. Friend
    <phrase class="honfriend" name="Chris Grayling" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10920">the
    Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase> has ensured that the plight
    of the hedgehog has been greatly debated during the passage of the Bill, and the
    Green Paper that we plan later this year will also explore how we might better
    protect other species currently not protected under the habitats regulations,
    including the hedgehog. In a similar vein, I have asked my noble Friend Lord Benyon
    to chair a small working group, together with Tony Juniper, Christopher Katkowski,
    QC, and the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton Deane.
    The group will explore how our approach to conservation and habitat assessment
    might be improved so that we can deliver nature&#8217;s recovery and hit the ambitious
    targets that we are setting.</p><p pid="b473.0/7">Our world-leading targets will
    be supported by provisions in the Bill and our new England trees and peat action
    plans to protect existing trees and expand woodland coverage. Our aim is to treble
    woodland creation rates by the end of this Parliament and to restore 35,000 hectares
    of peatland by 2025. Although we treasure our many species and ecosystems for
    their own sake and their intrinsic value, we must remember that they also provide
    vital services from which people benefit, such as carbon storage and pollination.
    As shown in the Dasgupta review, protecting and enhancing our natural assets and
    the biodiversity that underpins them is crucial to achieving a sustainable, resilient
    economy.</p><p pid="b473.0/8">The Bill takes important strides in tackling air,
    water and waste pollution. Cleaner air from new, legally binding targets will
    drive action to tackle harmful air pollution across the country. Better management
    of our water for new drainage and sewage management plans will improve water quality
    in our rivers and lakes. The Bill will also give us powers to tackle storm overflows,
    and I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Philip Dunne"
    person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11696">the Member for Ludlow (Philip Dunne)</phrase>
    for his efforts on that particular area of policy. We therefore intend to table
    an amendment in the other place requiring Government to publish plans to reduce  sewage
    discharges from storm overflows by September 2022, and for water companies and
    the Environment Agency to publish storm overflow operations data on an annual
    basis.</p><p pid="b473.0/9">We are already consulting on measures to prevent waste
    and tackle the scourge of plastic ending up in our oceans. The extended producer
    responsibility scheme, which will make producers of packaging responsible for
    the cost of disposal, will incentivise better product design from the outset.
    New powers will allow us to place charges on single-use plastics, reducing their
    persistence in our natural environment. All of this, of course, will be underpinned
    by our new system of environmental governance. The Bill creates the new, independent
    Office for Environmental Protection to hold all public authorities to account
    on reaching these important goals. Work to establish the OEP is already well under
    way under the chairmanship of Dame Glenys Stacey and I commend the work that she
    has done to date.</p><p pid="b473.0/10">In conclusion, I am pleased to see this
    Bill reach its Third Reading after a couple of attempts in previous Sessions and
    during the last Parliament. I am grateful for the many contributions from Members
    of all parties today. I believe that these provisions will ensure that this generation
    leaves our environment in a better state than we found it, and I therefore commend
    the Bill to the House.</p>

    speak to the motion in my name and those of my right hon. and hon. Friends. However,
    it gives me no pleasure whatsoever to be standing here yet again calling for this
    Government to act to secure our borders against the threat of new variants of
    covid. The news that the Prime Minister has announced a delay in the reopening
    on <phrase class="date" code="2021-06-21">21 June</phrase> was a hammer blow to
    people across the country. Freedoms that have been denied us for so long seemed
    within our grasp, yet they have been snatched away. Let us be absolutely clear:
    the impact of what the Prime Minister announced last night is devastating, but
    it was not inevitable. That delay is happening because of the delta variant first
    identified in India, and the delta variant is here in such force because of lax
    Conservative border policy.</p><p pid="d187.1/4">The fallout from that chain of
    events is enormous for pubs and restaurants that were desperate to open up properly
    again; for friends planning group holidays that have been ruined; for our towns
    and city centres hoping to have been bustling with workers again; for concerts,
    sports stadiums, theatres and festivals that were supposed to be filling up; and
    for families looking forward to great big get-togethers, celebrating milestones,
    birthdays, children being born and marriages. I want my thoughts today to be with
    all those who have seen their wedding plans turned upside down. I realise of course
    that weddings are legally allowed, but with singing and dancing banned, I do not
    think they will look like the parties that many of us know weddings to be.</p><p
    pid="d187.1/5">This will be a desperate blow for so many people, and the cost
    of this delay will not just be felt in people&#8217;s disappointment and ruined
    plans. UKHospitality says that a delay of a month will cost its sector &#163;3
    billion in sales, with warnings that 200,000 jobs in the sector could go. Some
    5,000 gigs are set to be cancelled at a cost of &#163;500 million. Let us be absolutely
    clear: the responsibility for breaking the promise of freedom day lies squarely
    with this Conservative Government. The Prime Minister apparently says that his
    political hero is the mayor from &#8220;Jaws&#8221;, keeping the beaches open
    while swimmers were getting attacked. The truth is that he has let the shark take
    a huge chunk out of the British economy this week. People across the country have
    every right to be angry about being let down so badly.</p><p pid="d187.1/6">Madam
    Deputy Speaker, through you perhaps I can echo the strong words of Mr Speaker
    yesterday in condemning the shoddy way in which the Government have treated this
    House on an announcement of national  importance. Our role is to represent our
    constituents, and the Prime Minister failing to make the statement to this House
    or to offer himself for questioning was, frankly, an insult.</p><p pid="d187.1/7">Everyone
    knows that managing the pandemic is a huge challenge for Governments across the
    world, and of course the British public can forgive mistakes, but what is unforgivable
    is making the same mistakes time and time again, putting the health and prosperity
    of the British people at risk. As an island, our border protections should have
    been one of our strengths. Instead, they have been an Achilles heel. Time and
    again, I have stood here and warned that the UK Government&#8217;s border measures
    are far too weak, yet from the very outset of the pandemic, Government actions
    at the border have been too little, too late.</p><p pid="d187.1/8">At the outset
    of the pandemic, just 273 people out of the 18 million that arrived here by air
    were formally quarantined between <phrase class="date" code="2021-01-01">1 January</phrase>
    and <phrase class="date" code="2021-03-23">23 March</phrase> last year&#8212;just
    273 people from four flights. In fact, on <phrase class="date" code="2021-03-13">13
    March</phrase> last year, even the voluntary guidance that was in place on self-isolation
    when coming from parts of China and South Korea and from Iran and Italy was lifted.
    We have never had a credible explanation for that. All this came at a time when
    we saw the terrible scenes in northern Italy of hospitals being overwhelmed, when
    our constituents were contacting us and questioning why there were not better
    and more effective controls at airports, and when the Government&#8217;s own chief
    scientific adviser said that</p><p class="indent" pid="d187.1/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a
    lot of the cases in the UK didn&#8217;t come from China&#8230;they came from European
    imports and the high level of travel into the UK at that time.&#8221;</p><p pid="d187.1/10">There
    is no point in the Government claiming that they have the toughest border protections
    in the world. In that same month, March 2020, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada and
    New Zealand restricted entry to residents and citizens and introduced a 14-day
    quarantine for all arrivals. It could be done, and it was done; it just was not
    done by this Government. I wrote to the Home Secretary in April 2020 to ask her
    to learn the lessons from that, but still the UK remained an international outlier.
    In May 2020, the UK stood with only Iran, Luxembourg and the US Virgin Islands
    in having no border protection measures in place, and that, I am afraid, has been
    the story of the pandemic at the borders.</p><p pid="d187.1/11">This Conservative
    Government have been late to formal quarantining. It was not introduced until
    June 2020, and even then only 3% of the people meant to be quarantining were successfully
    checked. The Government have been late to mandatory border testing, which was
    not introduced until January 2021, and late to start hotel quarantining, which
    started in February 2021 and even then covered only 1% of arrivals. They have
    been late and lacking in strategy, with no proper plan, just lurching from one
    position to another. It is no wonder that the border policy of this Government
    has been a tale of systematic failure. The Government did not so much leave the
    back door open to covid and its variants as leave the front door open the whole
    time.</p><p pid="d187.1/12">Let me pay tribute to Border Force, the police and
    our wider law enforcement community. They have worked heroically. The gaps in
    our defences that have existed and do exist are not their fault, but the fault
    of Ministers. That chronic failure has been crystallised in the utter  mess over
    hotel quarantining. On <phrase class="date" code="2021-02-01">1 February</phrase>,
    we on the Opposition Benches forced a debate and a vote on covid security at the

    is calling for decisive action today through a comprehensive hotel quarantine
    policy, and that would mean a policy of enforced quarantine restrictions on arrivals&#8230;Failing

    on earth can the Government be assured that the measures will prevent emerging
    strains from countries outside those on the red list? The truth is that the Government
    cannot answer that question. As a result, the policy is fatally flawed. A comprehensive
    quarantine policy would give us the best possible chance of preventing a new strain

  question: The Deputy Speaker put forthwith the Question already proposed from the
    Chair (Standing Order No. 83E), That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="c695.1/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
    Third time.</p><p pid="c695.1/2">The Bill delivers on our promise to the British
    people to keep them safe. It backs our police with improved powers and more support
    for officers and their families in recognition of the unique and enormous sacrifices
    that they make. It introduces tougher sentences for the worst offenders and modernises
    the criminal justice system with an overhaul of the courts and tribunal processes.</p><p
    pid="c695.1/3">The long-overdue police covenant represents our promise to the
    police and their families that we will do everything we can to honour and support
    them. That includes much more support for their health and wellbeing. As the House
    knows, the Bill requires the Home Secretary to report annually to Parliament on
    the covenant, and this will now cover the whole policing family.</p><p pid="c695.1/4">We
    rely on the police for our public safety and protection. We have relied on them
    more than usual during the covid pandemic to enforce new laws and, of course,
    to keep us safe. The overwhelming majority of the country has responded with profound
    gratitude, but a thuggish minority has responded with abuse and violence. In the
    year from December 2019 to 2020, there was a big increase in assaults on police
    officers. Assaults on constables without injury increased by 21%&#8212;just over
    25,000. Assaults on constables with injury went up by 2%, but that is still over
    11,000 cases. It is despicable and it cannot and should not be tolerated, so the
    Bill doubles the maximum penalty for assaulting emergency workers, including those
    heroic NHS workers, to two years. Serious violence reduction orders will also
    give the police targeted stop-and-search powers for convicted knife and weapon
    carriers.</p><p pid="c695.1/5">The police will be able to take a more proactive
    approach to managing protests. That is not about stifling freedom of expression.
    The right to protest peacefully is a cornerstone of our democracy, but there is
    a balance to be struck between the rights of the protester and the rights of others
    to go about their daily lives. The current legislation that the police use to
    manage protests, the Public Order Act 1986, was enacted over 30 years ago. Tactics
    such as blocking emergency vehicles, gluing oneself to a train, blocking airport
    runways and preventing the distribution of newspapers are unacceptable and illegitimate.
    They will be treated as such. By attempting to strike out those clauses, Labour
    has proved that it is on the side of the disruptive minority and not the hard-working
    majority.</p><p pid="c695.1/6">Victims and witnesses need to know that they are
    safe, and of course the Bill reforms the pre-charge bail regime, which will bring
    much-needed reassurance, including in high-harm cases such as domestic abuse.
    People convicted of serious crimes will receive tougher sentences and spend longer
    in prison. Automatic halfway release  from prison will end for another cohort
    of serious sexual and violent offenders. A whole life tariff order will be the
    starting point for the premediated murder of a child. The Government&#8217;s comprehensive
    rape review is soon to be followed by a comprehensive strategy to tackle violence
    against women and girls, and domestic abuse. These problems are complex and widespread,
    so we need to do much more to combat them. The Bill strengthens the management
    of sex offenders by, for example, enabling the courts to impose electronic monitoring
    requirements and behavioural change courses. There are new powers to manage terrorism
    risk offenders.</p><p pid="c695.1/7">The Bill provides more agile and appropriate
    management of children in the justice system&#8212;something that we should never
    overlook&#8212;so that judges and magistrates can make decisions in the best interest
    of the child and the public. Secure schools will be trialled with a focus on excellent
    education, wellbeing and purposeful activity.</p><p pid="c695.1/8">Because of
    covid, temporary provisions were made to allow people to participate in and follow
    court proceedings by video and audio technology. Those have worked well and will
    be made permanent. We will also make the courts more accessible for people with
    disabilities.</p><p pid="c695.1/9">Our first responsibility as a Government is
    to keep the public safe. The vital provisions in the Bill will strengthen public
    safety and update the law. They will mean that the police can manage new and emerging
    threats and that the criminal justice system works for the British people, keeping
    our citizens and our communities safe.</p><p pid="c695.1/10">As we prepare to
    vote, I urge Labour Members to ask themselves whose side they are on. The public
    whom they serve will notice. The measures are emphatically on the side of the
    police and the law-abiding majority of the British people, and I commend the Bill
    to the House.</p>

    across the House, is what our motion says in relation to the enormous contribution
    that our EU nationals have made to every part of the UK: to our economy, our public
    services and culturally. I hope we also all agree that we want these EU citizens
    to stay. That is why we selected this topic for debate: to allow us to press the
    Government on whether their settlement scheme really reflects those goals as well
    as it could, and what we feel are the obstacles making it harder for some to stay
    than it should be. It gives us the opportunity to ask what happens now that the
    EU settlement scheme deadline has passed and what can be done to protect those
    who, as things stand, have lost their rights.</p><p pid="b970.2/5">In a moment,
    I will get into the nuts and bolts of the rather messy situation we find ourselves
    in, but it is important to start by making clear what happened last week and why.
    Last Thursday morning, at the stroke of midnight, thanks to policy choices made
    by successive Conservative Governments, tens and almost certainly hundreds of
    thousands of people to all intents and purposes lost their rights to live, work,
    study and enjoy family life here in this country. It does not matter how long
    they have been here or whether they really have any home elsewhere, the clock
    struck midnight and these people became subject to the full force of the hostile
    environment. The first question for the Minister is whether he will tell the House
    what estimate the Home Office has made of the number of those who have failed  to
    apply prior to the deadline. If we are to have a proper discussion about the scheme,
    surely that is the least of the information the Government must provide?</p>'

    the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.</p><p pid="c420.2/4">It is
    a privilege to introduce my first ten-minute rule motion on such an important
    issue, which is affecting so many of my constituents in Luton South and so many
    people across the country. We need a bold plan to tackle the housing crisis, but
    the Government&#8217;s planning White Paper will restrict local communities&#8217;
    ability to shape their own area, allow for the creation of poor-quality housing
    through permitted development rights and allow developers to sit on planning permissions
    rather than build desperately needed, truly affordable housing. It amounts to
    nothing more than a developer&#8217;s charter that restricts communities while
    benefiting wealthy developers. This Bill would ensure that local communities&#8217;
    right to participate in the planning process at a local level and on individual
    applications is protected.</p><p pid="c420.2/5">This measure is vital, as the
    Government&#8217;s White Paper intends to create a zonal approach to local plans,
    weakening local authorities&#8217; and communities&#8217; detailed oversight of
    the planning process. That represents a shift away from public engagement and
    scrutiny of individual planning decisions on applications to engagement only at
    the overarching local plan stage, which greatly restricts, and in many cases removes,
    the rights of local councillors, local resident associations and local residents
    to shape or object to a particular planning application in their area. It seems
    as though the Government&#8217;s solution to speeding up planning is to remove
    the rights of local people and councillors to have a say in the planning process,
    rather than tackling other obstacles. The Government&#8217;s plan to remove the
    voice of local communities has been opposed by a wide range of groups, from the
    Local Government Association to Civic Voice and the Town and Country Planning
    Association.</p><p pid="c420.2/6">The delivery of new, truly affordable homes
    must be pursued through a locally led planning system with public participation
    at its heart. Indeed, just last night Luton Borough Council unanimously passed
    a motion that emphasised that planning works best when developers work with the
    local community and called on the Government to protect the right of communities
    to object to individual planning applications. I would point out that even councillors
    from the Government&#8217;s party supported that motion. The Select Committee
    on Housing, Communities and Local Government, of which I am a member, also recommended
    in &#8220;The future of the planning system in England&#8221; report:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="c420.2/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;All individuals must still be able to
    comment and influence upon all individual planning proposals.&#8221;</p><p pid="c420.2/8">This
    Bill would reflect Luton Borough Council&#8217;s motion and the Select Committee&#8217;s
    recommendation by legislating to ensure that people have the right to participate
    in development plans and associated examination hearings.</p><p pid="c420.2/9">The
    Government also intend to end the statutory planning notice requirement to inform
    local people through notices in local papers, on community noticeboards, and on
    lampposts and, potentially, through hard copies of documents, in favour of using
    just technology. The Select Committee heard about how local people want to continue
    to be able to comment on specific local planning applications and that the proposal
    to drop the legal requirement to publish planning notices in local newspapers
    and the like would create a &#8220;postcode lottery&#8221; as to where that opportunity
    continues. That would undermine local democracy, by creating barriers for those
    who do not have digital access, such as the elderly or those on low incomes. Instead,
    the Select Committee recommended retaining &#8220;existing statutory notices&#8221;
    for all local authorities, alongside using technology, to make the planning process
    as accessible as possible.</p><p pid="c420.2/10">This Bill would also expand the
    right to participate to include permitted development, which currently does not
    allow for objections from residents, and also seeks to allow local planning authorities
    to set local design standards for when an application is made for prior approval
    through the permitted development process. Constituents have also contacted me
    to raise their frustrations at how local planning authorities do not have sufficient
    power to oppose planning applications. The Select Committee has heard that permitted
    development rights</p><p class="indent" pid="c420.2/11" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;weaken
    local authorities&#8217; ability to shape places; and diminish community engagement
    in the planning process.&#8221;</p><p pid="c420.2/12">A report the Government
    commissioned on the impact of permitted development homes concluded that</p><p
    class="indent" pid="c420.2/13" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;permitted development
    conversions do seem to create worse-quality residential environments than planning
    permission conversions in relation to a number of factors widely linked to the
    health, well-being and quality of life of future occupiers.&#8221;</p><p pid="c420.2/14">Many
    Members from across the House will also have heard horror stories of where permitted
    development rights have allowed the creation of poor-quality housing in their
    constituency. One such example is at Unity House in Luton, an office building
    converted through permitted development rights which houses families with children
    alongside a four-lane inner ring road. This permitted conversion brought more
    people into an area that is within an air quality management zone because of traffic
    congestion. It was allowed to happen because permitted development rights bypass
    necessary planning permission and air quality regulations. When the Government&#8217;s
    own former housing adviser Ben Clifford warned that the changes to permitted development
    risk creating the &#8220;slums of the future&#8221; I had to agree.</p><p pid="c420.2/15">This
    Bill allows local planning authorities to refuse prior approval if the development
    would be to the detriment of the health and wellbeing of an individual or the
    wider community, therefore preventing poor-quality homes that are in inappropriate
    locations or that lack adequate community infrastructure, such as shops, schools
    and parks.</p><p pid="c420.2/16">I have seen in Luton children having to play
    football in the middle of the pedestrian area in the town centre as a consequence
    of a higher density of housing being  created in former commercial premises in
    the town centre under PDR without any consideration of local amenities. The children
    in my town deserve so much better.</p><p pid="c420.2/17">Last year Labour formally
    opposed the Government&#8217;s changes to PDR which allowed for additional storeys
    to be placed on existing developments such as flats and houses. It is clear that
    the measures in this Bill are needed to prevent the creation of homes through
    PDR, further damaging people&#8217;s, including children&#8217;s, health and wellbeing.
    The housing crisis will not be addressed through PDR&#8217;s creation of poor-quality
    housing and will certainly not be addressed while developers sit on planning permissions.
    The failure to ensure that sites with planning permission have been built on is
    a key driver behind the Government&#8217;s poor record on house building.</p><p
    pid="c420.2/18">According to analysis by the Local Government Association, more
    than 1.1 million homes granted planning permission in England in the past decade
    are yet to be built. As the LGA also said, local plans are not holding up the
    building of new housing, with more than 1 million homes on land earmarked for
    development by councils yet to be brought forward by developers for planning permission.
    Currently the requirement is for the development to begin within three years of
    permission being granted. This allows developers to land-bank, which means holding
    land and selling it in the future when its value rises. We need to incentivise
    developers to build. That is why the Bill would ensure that planning permission
    for major housing schemes will be granted only on the condition that development
    begins within two years of planning permission being granted.</p><p pid="c420.2/19">This
    Bill safeguards the interests of my constituents and many of the organisations
    that are deeply concerned about the Government&#8217;s planning proposals. It
    lays the foundation for a planning system that allows local people to shape their
    place and deliver good-quality homes that promote health and wellbeing.</p><p

    pid="c265.0/2">Some of the wider claims we have heard in today&#8217;s debate

    of the scaremongering when this Government successfully introduced individual
    electoral registration. Many Opposition Members cried that that would result in
    mass disenfranchisement, but we saw the effect in the last UK general election,
    when a record number of people were registered to vote. The Minister for the Constitution
    and Devolution, one of the hardest working Ministers with whom I have had the
    pleasure to work and herself no stranger to Northern Ireland, excellently articulated
    the reasonable and considered approach we are taking across the Bill.</p><p pid="c265.0/3">We

    to try to answer some of the points that have been raised and some of the questions
    that have been put to me in Members&#8217; contributions. Before I do, however,
    I think it is worth reflecting on the work undertaken to get to this point and
    the long pedigree of some of the measures in the Bill. This is not just a product
    of the Government or the Cabinet Office; it has been inspired, informed and enhanced
    by the input of a wide variety of organisations and individuals. We are grateful
    to a number of parliamentary Committees, many of whose thoughtful contributions
    are reflected in the measures and some of whose Chairs we heard from in today&#8217;s
    debate. To highlight just a few individuals, the important contribution of Lord
    Pickles has been critical in understanding the very real risks and challenges
    our electoral system faces. Similarly, the reports by colleagues in this House,
    as well as by the House of Lords Select Committee on Democracy and Digital Technologies,
    have highlighted key considerations, from the need for more transparency in areas
    of digital campaigning to political finance.</p><p pid="c265.0/5">Along with the
    valued contribution of the electoral sector experts, I know the Minister for the
    Constitution and Devolution has been meeting a wide range of organisations in
    the voluntary and community sector, which have raised some important points and
    will play a vital role in ensuring that the detail that will be developed in secondary
    legislation will meet the needs of all those who manage and use our electoral
    services. In particular, she is committed to continue engagement with people with
    disabilities, other minority groups and some of the key groups of vulnerable people
    who have been all too  often, as my hon. Friends the Members for Wycombe and for
    Bolsover pointed out, the major victims of electoral fraud.</p><p pid="c265.0/6">I

    of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I welcome the report published by
    the Committee in July. As the Minister for the Constitution and Devolution said,
    the recommendations will be given full and proper consideration, and the Government
    will respond. In fact, I should point out that we are bringing forward measures
    in the Bill which are closely linked to recommendations made in that report, such
    as a new requirement on political parties to declare their assets and liabilities
    over &#163;500 on registration, and a restriction of third-party campaigning to
    UK-based or otherwise eligible campaigners.</p><p pid="c265.0/8">My right hon.
    Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="David Davis" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10162">the
    Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> made a powerful speech,
    as he always does. Like many on the Government Benches, I happen to disagree with
    him on this particular one, but let me point out that the Government research
    he quoted also found out that 98% of people across the age groups have access
    to accepted forms of photographic ID already, 99% of people from ethnic minority
    groups have that level of access, and 99% of those aged between 18 and 29 already
    have an acceptable form of photographic identification.</p><p pid="c265.0/9">The
    hon. Members for Ceredigion (Ben Lake) and for Cynon Valley (Beth Winter) asked
    about important issues of engagement with the devolved Administrations. Devolution
    means that we already have different arrangements for devolved and reserved elections.
    We do engage regularly and I can offer him the reassurance he sought that the
    strategy document will not undermine the partnership between the Electoral Commission
    and the devolved Administrations.</p><p pid="c265.0/10">There are many other points
    that I would like to address, but I will not have time. Let me conclude by thanking
    hon. Members for all their valuable contributions. The Bill will place British
    citizens&#8217; participation at the heart of our democracy and will keep it modern,
    secure, transparent and fair, so that our democracy can continue to thrive. I
    know that my hon. Friend the Minister for the Constitution and Devolution will
    do an excellent job of steering it through Committee, and I look forward to a
    lively debate in the next phase of its passage. I commend the Bill to the House.</p><p

    losing everything to pay for it. The Government&#8217;s plan will make an extraordinary

    Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Mr Clarke)</phrase>, to his
    new role and congratulate him on his appointment.</p><p pid="c177.3/4">In our
    country today, working families face a sudden squeeze on living standards on a
    scale not seen for a generation: incomes are coming down; prices are going up,
    especially energy prices; taxes are going up; rents are going up; childcare costs
    are going up; fuel costs are going up; rail fares are going up. And with empty
    shelves in too many shops, restaurants closing because of meat shortages and now
    refrigerant shortages putting Christmas at risk, it is not just that people can
    afford less; there is also less to afford.</p><p pid="c177.3/5">The people of
    Britain face an extraordinary squeeze on their living standards this winter&#8212;not
    simply by chance, but because of the choices made by Conservative Governments
    this year, last year and in the 10 years before. It is not some tragic, unforeseeable
    series of unhappy accidents that brought us here today. It is a string of choices
    that this Government have made, sometimes in the face of evidence, sometimes against
    advice, sometimes through a dogmatic refusal to try, and sometimes simply through
    a lazy and complacent failure to take the hard decisions that government involves.
    Time and again, through the pandemic and the long years before it, the Government
    have left issues to fester  rather than taking action to address them, and then
    rushed at the last moment, only to find that it is too late and the damage is
    done.</p><p pid="c177.3/6">I said at the beginning that incomes are going down,
    prices are going up, taxes are up, rents are up, childcare costs are up, fuel
    costs are up and rail fares are up. Let me take each one in turn.</p><p pid="c177.3/7">Ten
    months ago, the Chancellor set out his policy of a public sector pay freeze. Like
    so much of his policy making, it was a triumph of short-term accountancy over
    rational economics. Public sector workers&#8212;council staff cleaning our parks
    in lockdown, police officers on the frontline, teaching assistants doing everything
    they can to give our children the best possible start in life&#8212;are not somehow
    separate from the rest of the economy. They buy food from the same shops as their
    neighbours working for private firms. Their children go to the same schools as
    private sector workers. They shop on the same high streets. They visit the same
    pubs and caf&#233;s. Taking money from their pockets while the recovery is so
    fragile&#8212;and it is so fragile&#8212;is taking money from our shops, our high
    streets, our economy. It is pulling demand out of our economy at the worst possible
    moment.</p><p pid="c177.3/8">But the Government have not been content with clobbering
    those who did so much to keep our country running during the pandemic. In just
    a few weeks&#8217; time, they are putting their hands in pockets once again: the
    pockets of the millions of families in our country&#8212;40% of them in working
    households, doing everything the Government have asked of them&#8212;for whom
    universal credit is what keeps them out of poverty. Again, let us be clear: many
    of the people being clobbered by this hit are the heroes whose bravery in the
    face of a then little understood disease kept this country running through lockdown
    after lockdown.</p><p pid="c177.3/9">The Government are taking &#163;20 each week
    from every family who receive universal credit. Government Members may choose
    to forget what that means. In the years ahead, their voters will remember the
    choices that they made. They will have heard from their own constituents, as I
    have heard, the growing worry and anger of the people they represent&#8212;the
    genuine sense of surprise that any Government could do this, mixed with a lasting
    fury that the Government really are doing this. Twenty pounds each week is not
    simply a number. It is school shoes, a gas bill, dinner on the table, and decent
    meals for the children.</p>'

  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="d493.3/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read
    a Second time.</p><p pid="d493.3/2">On Sunday, MPs across the House remembered
    all those who died in conflict. It is now 76 years on from the time we started
    to rebuild our country from the devastation of world war two. The bombs that rained
    down during that war caused enormous loss of life. They tore our cities apart.
    In London, air raids wrecked or razed to the ground some 116,000 buildings, and
    in Liverpool and Bristol tens of thousands of buildings were damaged or destroyed.</p><p
    pid="d493.3/3">While the war left a mark on the nation that lasts to this day,
    those dark years were followed by a period of reconstruction and renewal. In 1951,
    the iconic Royal Festival Hall opened in London as the centrepiece and legacy
    of the Festival of Britain. In the 1960s, Liverpool built its extraordinary Metropolitan
    Cathedral, while the iconic Severn bridge was constructed near Bristol.</p><p
    pid="d493.3/4">Today, we are living in very different times, and we have thankfully
    not experienced such devastation here again, but we share some parallels with
    our wartime predecessors. As we emerge from the pandemic, our cities&#8217; buildings
    may remain intact, but jobs, families and livelihoods have been at risk, and some
    have been damaged by the worst economic shock in 300 years. It is right, therefore,
    that we too now rebuild and turn our attention to creating a better future for
    this country and its people. Last month, the Chancellor started that work. His
    Budget set out our plans for the stronger economy that will allow Britain to succeed:
    an economy of stronger growth, stronger employment and stronger public finances,
    with higher wages, high skills and rising productivity. This Finance Bill will
    achieve that.</p><p pid="d493.3/5">Before I turn to the Bill&#8217;s main measures,
    I will talk about its context. Our economic situation has improved since the last
    Finance Bill. We have moved away from emergency support to focusing on our recovery,
    which is now well under way. In fact, the economy is expected to bounce back to
    its pre-covid levels by the turn of the year&#8212;earlier than was expected in
    March&#8212;while our economic plan to safeguard jobs, livelihoods and businesses
    has worked. As a result, we can now invest in better public services, in jobs
    and skills, and in levelling up the country so that we open opportunity to everyone
    everywhere.</p><p pid="d493.3/6">However, we should not forget that debt is still
    at its highest level as a percentage of GDP since the early 1960s and is set to
    pass &#163;1.3 trillion. While this level of borrowing is still affordable, it
    leaves us vulnerable if another crisis hits, so we must continue to create a stronger
    economy that can withstand financial shocks. That is why the Chancellor announced
    a new charter for budget responsibility, with two fiscal rules that will keep
    us on the right track.</p><p pid="d493.3/7">I want to focus on three aspects of
    the Budget in this Finance Bill: support for people, support for businesses and
    growth, and some underlying aspects of fairness.  This is a Government who put
    people first, and this Bill&#8217;s measures complement the wider action we took
    in the Budget to support individuals and working families right around the country.
    We have reduced the universal credit taper rate and increased the national living
    wage so that work really does pay. We have continued our fuel duty freeze, helping
    to lower the cost of everyday life. We have announced that public sector workers
    will receive fair and affordable pay rises across the whole spending review period.</p><p
    pid="d493.3/8">This Bill will improve people&#8217;s lives by backing the businesses
    that generate jobs and growth. In March, we extended the temporary &#163;1 million
    level of annual investment allowance on plant and machinery assets. The allowance
    was due to revert to its previous level of &#163;200,000, but as the Chancellor
    said:</p><p class="indent" pid="d493.3/9" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;Now is not
    the time to remove tax breaks on investment&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, <phrase
    class="date" code="2021-10-27">27 October</phrase> 2021; Vol. 702, c. 283.]</p><p
    pid="d493.3/10">This Bill extends the &#163;1 million level until the end of March
    2023, encouraging firms to invest more and invest earlier.</p><p pid="d493.3/11">While
    the changes to business rates that we announced in the Budget will encourage more
    firms to grow and invest, the Bill will also help the UK&#8217;s financial services
    industry became even more successful. In the March Budget, we said we would increase
    the corporation tax rate to 25% from 2023, for which we have now legislated. However,
    to make sure that our banks stay internationally competitive while still paying
    their fair share of tax, this Bill sets the bank surcharge rate at 3%. In addition,
    we are increasing the bank surcharge annual allowance from &#163;25 million to
    &#163;100 million, a move that will help smaller, challenger banks.</p><p pid="d493.3/12">The
    Bill also supports another important industry&#8212;shipping. It does this by
    making our tonnage tax regime simpler and more competitive, and by rewarding companies
    that adopt the UK red ensign.</p><p pid="d493.3/13">Finally, we should not forget
    that our cultural industries also contribute to our economic success. This Bill
    therefore extends the tax relief on museum and gallery exhibitions for another
    two years until the end of March 2024, and it doubles the tax relief for theatres,
    orchestras, museums and galleries until April 2023, to revert to the normal rate
    only in April 2024. This tax relief for culture is worth a quarter of a billion
    pounds.</p><p pid="d493.3/14">Tax is of course central to our economic health
    and to funding the public services that make people&#8217;s lives better, but
    the way we collect tax must be fair and simple too, and the measures in this Bill
    will help us to achieve that. As Members will be aware, we are tackling the social
    care crisis with a new UK-wide 1.25% levy on national insurance contributions.
    This Bill will increase the tax rate on dividends by the same amount, so that
    those receiving this income will also contribute in line with employees and the
    self-employed.</p>'

    honesty and leadership. We should all aspire to them and cherish them, as I said
    yesterday.</p><p pid="d624.2/7">I urge all hon. Members on both sides of the House
    to consider those principles when they make their decision on which Division Lobby
    to walk through later this afternoon, because those values must underpin all that
    we do in this House and on behalf of our constituents outside this House. It is
    our constituents and the country that we serve, not private interests. We are
    not paid MPs for hire.</p><p pid="d624.2/8">Over the past two weeks, I am afraid
    to say&#8212;it gives me no pleasure&#8212;that we have seen some of the very
    worst of some on the Government Benches. That has included refusing to deal with
    one of their own MPs found guilty of sexual harassment and then trying to change
    the rules on standards to protect one of their mates who had broken the rules.
    That leaves the reputation of Parliament and our precious democracy in danger
    of disrepute. The Prime Minister had to publicly decree last week that the UK
    is not a &#8220;corrupt country&#8221;.</p>'

    during an Opposition day debate the Tories will berate Opposition parties for
    not dealing with the issue of the day, crying distraction and somehow suggesting
    that the discourse in this place of those on the Opposition Benches is focused
    solely on the interests of the SW1 chatterati, not what matters most to our constituents
    back home. However, today of all days, not least in the light of what Lord Agnew
    has just done along the corridor, that seems somewhat ironic, given that the Tories
    themselves are engaged in a civil war and are besieged by paralysis, with a Prime
    Minister who might be in office, but is certainly not in power. Let us be clear
    that we have a British Government and Prime Minister who are so focused on saving
    their own skins that they are neglecting to get on with the day job; indeed, they
    are overlooking the biggest issue of the day: the cost-of-living crisis.</p><p

    constituency MPs, we know that it is certainly impacting the poorest and most
    vulnerable members of society, and yet this British Government indulge in navel-gazing,
    while our constituents are stuck in the middle of an economic tornado. Simply,
    the Tories are more focused on saving &#8220;Big Dog&#8221; than on saving our
    constituents&#8217; money from spiralling energy bills, and more focused on Operation
    Red Meat when our constituents can hardly afford red meat, as inflation causes
    the average supermarket shop to skyrocket.</p><p pid="c741.2/5">Like most Scots,

  full_motion_speech: <p pid="d413.0/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the
    Third time.</p><p pid="d413.0/2">In the autumn Budget, the Chancellor set out
    a vision to build a stronger economy that would allow this country to bounce back
    from the pandemic. This Finance Bill takes forward measures that will help to
    turn that vision into reality and drive growth for our country long into the future.
    Its measures will support business across the UK, including our banking, creative
    and shipping sectors. In addition, the Bill will protect businesses and the public
    by clamping down on tax evasion and economic crime, improving trust and building
    a fairer UK economy.</p><p pid="d413.0/3">I turn first to the measures in the
    Bill designed to safeguard and strengthen industry and the wider economy. To help
    businesses invest and grow, we are extending the annual investment allowance at
    its highest-ever level of &#163;1 million until <phrase class="date" code="2022-03-31">31
    March</phrase> 2023. The &#163;1 million AIA level means that more than 99% of
    businesses will have their plant and machinery expenditure covered.</p><p pid="d413.0/4">We
    are also extending the support offered to the creative industries by providing
    additional tax reliefs to theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries as the sector
    recovers. These rates of higher relief will provide a further incentive for new
    productions, exhibitions and concerts up to April 2024.</p><p pid="d413.0/5">Finally,
    reforms to the UK tonnage tax regime will encourage more firms to base their headquarters
    in the UK to use our world-leading maritime services industry and to fly the flag
    of the UK. This will bring jobs and investment throughout the country, and especially
    to our coastal communities.</p><p pid="d413.0/6">I now turn to how the Bill will
    deliver stronger public finances. The Bill sets the rate of the bank surcharge
    so that the combined rate on banks&#8217; profits will increase to 28% from April
    2023. It also increases the surcharge allowance to &#163;100 million. These changes
    will ensure that the banks continue to make a fair contribution while encouraging
    growth and competition for smaller groups within the UK banking market.</p><p
    pid="d413.0/7">The 1.25% increase on dividend income rates from <phrase class="date"
    code="2022-04-06">6 April</phrase> 2022 will help fund the health and social care
    settlement, ensuring that contributions are made based on employed and self-employed
    earnings. The Government are also introducing the new 4% residential developer
    tax on the most profitable developers. This will raise at  least &#163;2 billion
    over the next decade to help pay for the removal of unsafe cladding, providing
    reassurance to home owners and boosting confidence in the UK housing market.</p><p
    pid="d413.0/8">At the heart of this Finance Bill is the desire to safeguard taxpayers&#8217;
    interests and deal with those who avoid paying their fair share. The economic
    crime levy will help deliver the Government&#8217;s objectives to combat economic
    crime and will raise an expected &#163;100 million per year to fund anti-laundering
    measures. The levy is calculated by UK revenue and provides the fairest and simplest
    method for the anti-money laundering regulated sector to contribute further. That
    will cement the UK&#8217;s reputation as a secure country in which to conduct
    business and solidifies the Government&#8217;s ambition to permanently tackle
    economic crime.</p><p pid="d413.0/9">As I mentioned earlier, the Bill&#8217;s
    measures will clamp down on tax avoidance and evasion. It will give HMRC more
    powers to tackle promoters of tax avoidance schemes by levying penalties on UK
    entities that enable them. The measures are accompanied by an increase in the
    duty charge on tobacco products by 2% and a rise in the minimum excise tax to
    3% above RPI inflation, alongside new measures to tackle duty evasion. That will
    help reduce the long-term burden on the NHS and improve public health generally.</p><p
    pid="d413.0/10">By targeting businesses that manipulate electronic records to
    evade tax, the Bill reinforces the Government&#8217;s efforts to tackle unscrupulous
    businesses that carry out electronic sales suppression. The measures are essential
    to Britain&#8217;s reputation as a global hub for businesses and as a secure and
    transparent place in which to conduct business.</p><p pid="d413.0/11">I thank
    hon. and right hon. Members for their helpful and insightful contributions to
    the debates during the Bill&#8217;s passage.</p><p pid="d413.0/12">To conclude,
    this Finance Bill supports our efforts to build a stronger economy. It tackles
    tax evasion and avoidance, and, ultimately, its measures will create a brighter
    and simpler future for industry, the economy and the UK as a whole. For those
    reasons, I commend it to the House.</p>

    people housed in non-commissioned exempt accommodation under successive Conservative
    Governments; regrets the opportunities that this increase has provided for unscrupulous
    operators to exploit vulnerable individuals for financial gain at the taxpayers’
    expense; recognises that a range of factors have driven the marked growth of this
    sector including a chronic shortage of genuinely affordable housing, reductions
    in funding for housing-related support, new barriers to access for single adults
    requiring social rented housing or mainstream privately rented housing, and a
    weakening of regulation and oversight; further regrets the detrimental impact
    that the growth of poor quality non-commissioned exempt accommodation is having
    on the health and well-being of those vulnerable individuals placed in it and
    on the public purse; and calls on the Government to introduce a package of emergency
    measures designed to secure immediate improvements in the quality of non-commissioned
    exempt accommodation and associated support, to ensure claims for exempt Housing
    Benefit consistently provide value for money and to drive unscrupulous operators
    out of the sector.

    Benefit consistently provide value for money and to drive unscrupulous operators
    out of the sector.</p><p pid="a378.1/3">We move from the global to the very, very
    local. There is a scandal quietly unfolding in communities across this country,
    and today we set out our determination that the Government will finally take this
    seriously and act to put it right. Across Britain, from Blackpool to Birmingham,
    houses are being bought or rented supposedly to house vulnerable people in accommodation
    with extra care and help. Instead, these shameless profiteers are leaving vulnerable
    people languishing in disgusting, unsafe housing, and people who badly need our
    help are denied it. The taxpayer is paying for all of this and it is blighting
    entire neighbourhoods.</p><p pid="a378.1/4">It was right to ensure that those
    who genuinely provide or need supported housing could access enhanced housing
    benefit, because the cost of housing vulnerable people who need care and support
    is undeniably higher. Before I came to this place, I worked for Centrepoint, whose
    work with care leavers, and young people with mental health problems and addiction
    issues is second to none. It takes time, care and commitment to help those young
    people build the lives they deserve. But it is utterly wrong that we have allowed
    this system to be abused and used by people who are destroying entire communities.</p><p
    pid="a378.1/5">Very many good organisations do provide proper support through
    supported exempt accommodation, and they are as appalled as we are at this scandal&#8212;it
    cannot continue. Colleagues on the Opposition Benches have raised this issue time
    and again with Ministers. How can it possibly be that nearly 18 months after the
    Government recognised the problem and commissioned pilots to consider how to solve
    it, this is still going on? Over the past few years, this problem has skyrocketed.
    More than 150,000 households in this country are living in exempt accommodation&#8212;that
    is a 62% increase in five years. Not all of them are bad placements&#8212;some
    of them are a lifeline&#8212;but it is crystal clear that there is an growing
    scandal of rogue operators, who know how to cheat the system, and are making life
    a misery for the people they are supposed to care for and the people who live
    in these proud communities. They deserve so much better and we are determined
    that they are going to get it.</p><p pid="a378.1/6">I would like to thank colleagues
    from across this House, and particularly Members from Birmingham and Bristol,
    who have long recognised the growing scandal and campaigned hard to make it right.
    They are here today and I am sure that they will have plenty to say to the Minister
    about it. Many of our local councils, too, are doing great work to address the
    problem head-on. For example, Birmingham City Council has introduced greater scrutiny
    of new exempt benefit claims and encourages all providers to sign up to a set
    of quality standards for exempt accommodation. It has joined a partnership of
    voluntary and statutory agencies to produce a charter of rights for residents
    of supported exempt accommodation. But such efforts are thwarted by weak laws
    and a Government that will not grant them the powers to take action.</p><p pid="a378.1/7">This
    Government have not even given us the information that we deserve. It took a Freedom
    of Information Act request from the charity Crisis to tell us how many tenancies
    there are&#8212;we do not know where they are. There has been no announcement
    about the pilots for several months. We have not even been told whether they have
    ended, what they have concluded or the timetable for when action is going to be
    taken. But we do know this: the law is too weak. It says a provider must deliver
    care, support and supervision that is, in legal terms, &#8220;more than minimal&#8221;.
    But &#8220;more than minimal&#8221; has no firm definition, test or criteria It
    could mean having a manager who visits the property once in a blue moon or installing
    a CCTV system. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Jess Phillips"
    person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25364">the Member for Birmingham, Yardley
    (Jess Phillips)</phrase> told the Minister in a recent Westminster Hall debate,
    in one shocking incident a key worker visited a property where the tenant had
    just been murdered, mistook the murderer for the victim and told her mother she
    was fine&#8212;she was dead.</p><p pid="a378.1/8">We will hear many terrible stories
    today from colleagues in this House that show that this &#8220;more than minimal&#8221;
    definition is allowing these disgraceful firms and individuals to milk the taxpayer
    at the expense of some of the most vulnerable people in our country; they are
    destroying neighbourhoods and we are determined that the stories of those people
    affected will be heard in the highest levels of Government today.</p>'

    was a national scandal: 800 British workers sacked with no notice. Today, we learnt
    that they have been replaced with people earning just &#163;1.80 an hour. This
    was nothing short of a betrayal of the workers who protected this country&#8217;s
    supply chain during the pandemic. The personal cost to those workers has been
    profound&#8212;some of them have joined us in the Gallery today&#8212;and it is
    with those workers that we should begin.</p><p pid="b38.2/4">On Friday, like many
    colleagues, I stood side-by-side with sacked crew in Dover. There, I spoke to
    a married couple who had both been employees of P&amp;O Ferries for 14 years.
    They loved their jobs. They spoke movingly about how P&amp;O felt like a family:</p><p

    It was our life and we gave it our all.&#8221;</p><p pid="b38.2/8">The reward
    for that loyalty? A summary dismissal via a pre-recorded video. Years of dedication
    ended with them being marched off the ships they lived and worked on by private
    security guards. They have a four-year-old child that they no longer know how
    they will feed and clothe. They told me with tears in their eyes that they felt
    they had been treated like criminals.</p><p pid="b38.2/9">This was not a grim
    Dickensian depiction belonging to another era; this was the United Kingdom in
    the 21st century. It is nothing short of a scandal that this Dubai-owned company,
    which received millions in taxpayers&#8217; money during the pandemic, can tear
    up the rights of British workers, all while its profits soared by 52% last year.
    That cannot and must not stand. We cannot allow British workers and this country
    to be taken for a ride.</p><p pid="b38.2/10">The truth, however, is that P&amp;O
    Ferries and DP World did it precisely because they thought they could get away
    with it. They knew they could exploit the UK&#8217;s shamefully weak employment
    law. They knew the investments the Government have with them would be prized more
    highly than the livelihoods of 800 people. And they knew that when they did what
    they did, the Government would not stand in their way. The impotent response so
    far from Ministers shows that they were right to think that, because, I am afraid
    to say, when a loyal British workforce was threatened, Ministers completely failed
    to act.</p>'

    of living crisis is the biggest issue facing our country, which is why we have
    chosen it as the subject of today&#8217;s debate, and I welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s
    participation. We should start by being sober about the unprecedented social emergency
    our country faces. According to a report that has just been published by the Food
    Foundation, 2 million of our fellow citizens went without food for a whole day
    in the past month because they could not afford to eat; 7 million families had
    to skip a meal, and that was true of nearly half of those on universal credit.
    This is not just about families out of work; it is about families in work too.
    This is a social emergency and it is also a looming economic threat, depriving
    our economy of the spending power it needs. The question at the heart of this
    debate is whether this Gracious Speech, this Government and, yes, this Chancellor
    are up to the challenge this emergency represents.</p><p pid="d574.4/4">The Chancellor
    wants us to believe that his measures in response are the best we can do, but
    they are not&#8212;not by a long shot. The cost of living crisis is driven most
    of all by what is happening to energy bills, so let us look at  the three chances
    he has had in the past seven months to act on energy bills. Last August, nine
    months ago, the first energy price rise was announced&#8212;this was a &#163;139
    increase in the price cap. So way back then he knew what was happening. Then in
    October he delivered the Budget. Wholesale energy prices were rocketing and the
    warning signals were flashing, but the Chancellor did nothing. He should re-read
    that Budget speech, because I think it would make even him wince. It is a model
    of complacency. He had drunk his own Kool-Aid. He told the country back then that
    &#8220;wages are rising&#8221;, that we have &#8220;growth up&#8221; and that
    on inflation we have</p><p class="indent" pid="d574.4/5" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a

    biggest fall in living standards for 45 years. Growth turned negative in March,
    with the Bank of England suggesting that the economy is going to shrink through
    the winter. We are now set for the highest level of inflation for 40 years. The
    plan is not working; it is failing.</p>

    Our country has a cost of living crisis and a growth crisis, with prices rising,
    growth downgraded and no plan for the future. None of this, though, is inevitable.
    It is a consequence of Conservative decisions and the direction they have taken
    our economy in over the past 12 years.</p><p pid="b702.5/4">The Government are
    increasingly a rudderless ship, heading to the rocks, while they are willing to
    watch people financially drown in the process. Where is the urgency and the action?
    The time to change course is now. We need an emergency Budget to deal with the
    inadequacy of the Chancellor&#8217;s spring statement, with a windfall tax to
    help to get bills down and to help families and pensioners to weather the storm.
    On the day that inflation has reached a 40-year high, the Chancellor is missing
    in action. As energy bills and anxiety levels soar, the response from the Government
    diminishes in comparison.</p>

    crime, not detaching protesters from fuel gantries, not unsticking them from the
    M25, and not having to surround fuel dumps in Essex so that the petrol can get
    out to the people who need it to go about their daily business. The British people
    want the police to be catching rapists and putting them behind bars, detecting
    paedophiles and making sure that they pay for their crimes, and stopping young
    people of all types being murdered on a regular basis. That is what we want our
    police officers to do. This Bill will release them to do that job, and I hope

    Second time.</p><p pid="a175.3/2">The troubles represented a terrible period in
    Northern Ireland&#8217;s past and in these islands as a whole. They claimed the
    lives of some 3,500 people in Northern Ireland, across Great Britain and in Ireland.
    They left tens of thousands injured and they impacted all aspects of our society.
    Many across the whole of our country still bear the scars, both visible and invisible,
    today. That Northern Ireland in 2022 has come so far in so many ways is a testament
    to the spirit and strength of its people and to the vision, bravery and determination
    of those who forged the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement. It is also a testament
    to the sacrifice of those men and women who went out each morning to uphold democracy
    and save lives, rather than those who went out to take them.</p><p pid="a175.3/3">Looking
    around today, I see many wonderful examples of a transformed, inclusive, peaceful
    Northern Ireland, yet despite this exceptional progress, the troubles continue
    to cast a shadow over all those impacted and over wider society. Community tensions
    and divisive politics can undermine stability. This legacy of the troubles is
    an issue that successive Governments have attempted but ultimately been unable
    to resolve, because it concerns one of the most complex, sensitive and difficult
    periods in our country&#8217;s history, but we cannot stand by and do nothing;
    we cannot let the status quo continue. To do that would be a dereliction of our
    duty to the people of Northern Ireland and to those who served their country during
    that dark period. It would be a dereliction of duty to families across the United
    Kingdom who still seek answers about what happened to their loved ones, in some
    cases more than 50 years ago.</p><p pid="a175.3/4">This Government recognise the
    huge challenges involved in seeking to address Northern Ireland&#8217;s past.
    We have a responsibility to ensure that future generations do not suffer in the
    same way as those who have gone before them. With every year that goes by, the
    opportunity to obtain answers for those who lost loved ones in the troubles diminishes
    further. We have a responsibility to ensure that children can grow up together,
    be educated together and understand all aspects of our shared past&#8212;a past
    that, at times, was bitter, difficult and inordinately painful for everyone involved.</p><p
    pid="a175.3/5">The current system is broken. It is delivering neither justice
    nor information to the vast majority of families. The lengthy, adversarial and
    complex legal processes do not offer the most effective route to information recovery,
    nor do they foster understanding, acknowledgment or reconciliation. Faith in the
    criminal justice model to deal with legacy cases has been undermined. The high
    standard of proof required to secure a successful prosecution, combined with the
    passage of time and the difficulty in securing sufficient evidence, means that
    victims and their families very rarely, if ever, obtain the outcome they seek
    from the process.</p><p pid="a175.3/6">We need to be honest about the limitations
    of focusing on criminal justice as a means to secure truth and accountability
    in relation to what happened to those who were killed or injured. It is arguably
    cruel to perpetuate false hope while presenting no viable alternative to deliver
    the information that so many families and survivors seek. That is why we are introducing
    legislation that seeks to address this most difficult and sensitive of issues.</p>

    will start from the outset by saying what this debate is not about. It is not
    about the hard-working staff who have been so badly let down by the management
    and the Government. There are countless examples of the fact that the infrastructure
    that holds our country together is creaking&#8212;indeed, in some cases, at breaking
    point. There can be no doubt that the frankly shambolic state of the Passport
    Office is an example of the systemic failure that has been designed and delivered
    by successive Conservative Governments since 2010, because by the time covid hit
    us in early 2020, a decade of underinvestment had left us with our defences down,
    lacking resilience and ill prepared for an external shock such as a global pandemic.
    NHS waiting lists were already at record highs and there were already more than
    100,000 staff vacancies. A steady stream of Conservative Chancellors had failed
    to grow the British economy in line with western competitors, thus depriving the
    Exchequer of an eyewatering &#163;12 billion of potential income that could have
    helped us through the pandemic&#8212;or indeed &#163;30 billion if the growth
    trajectory that was established by the last Labour Government had continued.</p><p
    pid="d159.2/4">Manufacturing had been at best ignored and at worst actively undermined
    by successive Conservative Governments, with 230,000 job losses in manufacturing
    since 2015 alone, thus leaving our country staggeringly overdependent on China
    for everything from personal protective equipment to lateral flow tests, and culminating
    in the disgraceful spectacle of the Government wasting &#163;8.7 billion of taxpayers&#8217;
    money on PPE that did not even meet the required safety standards. A toxic Tory
    decade of incompetence and indifference left us in early 2020 with a high-tax,
    high-inflation, low-wage and low-resilience economy, so that when the pandemic
    struck, we were left stranded in the storm without so much as an umbrella for
    protection.</p><p pid="d159.2/5">But the catalogue of failure that left us in
    the lurch when covid struck has been matched only by the litany of errors that
    characterised the Government&#8217;s chaotic approach to planning for the end
    of lockdown restrictions.</p>

    pid="b317.4/3">The railway is one of the nation&#8217;s greatest legacies. The
    industrial revolution was forged upon it, and for two centuries it has been the
    means by which we have connected north and south, east and west. It is a proud
    part of our history, but the truth is that the railways in this country have fallen
    behind the times. When I became Transport Secretary three years ago, it was clear
    that our railways were expensive, inefficient, fragmented, unaccountable and desperately
    in need of modernising and reform. There were delays to upgrades, collapsing franchises
    and busy lines operating at the very peak of, and sometimes beyond, their capacity,
    suffering overcrowding and delays. Some working practices had not changed for
    decades. As a result, we have a railway today that is struggling to keep pace
    with modern living, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. Our railways need
    a new direction.</p><p pid="b317.4/4">Office workers are working from home more
    often and the railway has lost around a fifth of its passengers, and also a fifth
    of its income. The Government kept the railway running when most passengers stayed
    at home. We kept trains available for key workers and protected the brilliant
    railway workers who managed the track and ran the trains. So this Government have
    stepped in. We put our money where our mouth is and we committed &#163;16 billion
    to support the railways through covid. That is taxpayers&#8217; money, and it
    is the equivalent of &#163;600 for every household in this country. Put another
    way, it is the equivalent to &#163;160,000 per rail worker in this country. As
    a result, the trains continued to operate, the industry survived and not a single
    railway worker had to be furloughed or lost their job&#8212;not one. We stepped
    up, but the honest truth is that this level of subsidy&#8212;which, let us not
    forget, is not the Government&#8217;s money but the taxpayer&#8217;s&#8212;simply
    cannot continue forever. If our railways are to thrive, things must change.</p><p
    pid="b317.4/5">As I see it, there are four ways to bring about that change. First,
    we could continue to attempt to pump billions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money
    into the system in the same unsustainable way we have been doing for the last
    two years, but that would take money away from the NHS and schools. Secondly,
    we could ramp up fares, but that would price working people off our railways completely.
    Thirdly, we could cut services and lines, emulating those sweeping cuts made by
    Dr Beeching in the 1960s, making it harder for people to access our railways.
    I do not support any of those options, which leaves us with the fourth option:
    modernise the railways, making them more productive and getting the industry off
    taxpayer-funded life support.</p><p pid="b317.4/6">Make no mistake, as a Government
    we profoundly believe in our railways, which is why we have reopened abandoned
    routes and electrified thousands of miles of lines&#8212;not just the 63 miles
    that Labour managed to electrify over 13 years. It is why we have got behind projects
    such as High Speed 2, the Elizabeth line and Northern Powerhouse Rail, and rolled
    out contactless to 900 more stations and digital signalling across the network.
    And it is why we are transforming the industry through Great British Railways,
    ending the fragmentation and putting passengers first, but we need the industry
    to help with that transformation.</p>'

  question: Question put, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.Today, the
    House is considering the next stage of HS2—the section from Crewe to Manchester,
    a route that will bring high-speed rail to the heart of the north for the first
    time. When this section is completed, HS2 will link the UK’s three largest conurbations,
    Greater Manchester, the west midlands and London. It will double capacity on the
    UK’s busiest rail route, freeing up much-needed space on other congested rail
    lines.  It will halve journey times between Manchester and Birmingham, and it
    will speed passengers from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston in just one
    hour and 11 minutes —a trip that takes over two hours today. By transforming rail
    travel for millions of people each year and acting as a catalyst for investment,
    jobs and regeneration, this vital route will honour the Government’s defining
    commitment to levelling up our country.

    on Ministers&#8217; Interests remains unfilled, the Public Administration and
    Constitutional Affairs Committee shall appoint a specialist adviser, entitled
    the Adviser on Ministers&#8217; Interests, whose role shall be to advise the Committee
    on the effectiveness of the Ministerial Code and on any potential breaches of
    that Code.</p><p pid="b770.1/4">(2) The Adviser may initiate consideration of
    a potential breach of the Ministerial Code, and shall consider any such potential
    breach referred to him by the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs
    Committee.</p><p pid="b770.1/5">(3) When considering potential breaches of the
    Ministerial Code, the Adviser may advise the Public Administration and Constitutional
    Affairs Committee on the appropriate use of its powers to send for persons, papers
    and records in order to secure the information needed to consider any such potential
    breaches.</p><p pid="b770.1/6">(4) The Adviser shall submit a memorandum to the
    Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee reporting conclusions
    relating to a potential breach of the Ministerial Code.</p><p pid="b770.1/7">(5)
    The Adviser shall have leave to publish any memorandum submitted to the Committee
    under paragraph (4) which has not been published in full and has been in the Committee&#8217;s
    possession for longer than 30 sitting days.&#8221;</p><p pid="b770.1/8">What a
    pleasure it is to open this debate, especially as it is with the Minister for
    the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General. I will call him my right hon. and learned
    Friend now because I see him more often these days than I see my friends. It is
    always a pleasure to stand opposite him. Hopefully, he will be able to give us
    some answers today, so that we can build on that friendship.</p><p pid="b770.1/9">The
    truth is that, to lose one ethics adviser is an embarrassment, but to lose a second,
    just days after the Prime Minister&#8217;s anti-corruption tsar walked, too, means
    that it has become a pattern&#8212;a pattern of degrading the principles of our
    democracy; a pattern of dodging accountability; and a pattern of demeaning his
    office. The Prime Minister has now driven both of his own hand-picked ethics advisers
    to resign in despair&#8212;twice in two years. It is a badge of shame for this
    Government and it should be for the rogue Prime Minister, too. If he was capable
    of feeling any shame, Lord Geidt has described the resignation as a &#8220;last
    resort&#8221; that</p><p class="indent" pid="b770.1/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;sends
    a critical signal into the public domain.&#8221;</p><p pid="b770.1/11">Well, he
    has certainly sent that signal, Madam Deputy Speaker. In his damning resignation
    letter, Lord Geidt spoke of the &#8220;odious&#8221; and &#8220;impossible&#8221;
    position that he had been put in. He said that the Prime Minister had made a &#8220;mockery&#8221;
    of the &#8220;Ministerial Code&#8221; and that he would play no further part in
    this. It was not about steel at all; it was about this Prime Minister&#8217;s
    casual and constant disregard for the rules. Lord Geidt could not stomach it any
    longer, and I do not blame him. To this Prime Minister, ethics is a county east
    of London.</p><p pid="b770.1/12">The truth is that the Prime Minister behaves
    as though it is one rule for him and another for the rest of us, because that
    is what he thinks. Scandal after scandal has hit him and his Government. His previous
    adviser on ministerial interests, the respected Sir Alex Allan, resigned when
    the Prime Minister chose to excuse the  Home Secretary despite the fact that she
    had breached the ministerial code by bullying civil servants. Sir Alex could not
    stand by and condone bullying, and the Prime Minister was more than happy to.
    After losing his first independent adviser, it took five months to appoint a new
    one&#8212;five months during which ministerial misconduct was left unchecked,
    creating a huge backlog of sleaze and misconduct by Tory Ministers. Lord Geidt
    himself complained about this backlog.</p><p pid="b770.1/13">This House should
    not tolerate a repeat performance. We cannot endure another five months with no
    accountability in Downing Street. We cannot endure another five minutes of it.
    Since Lord Geidt resigned, the Government have refused to confirm if or how his
    ongoing investigations will continue. I hope my new right hon. and learned Friend
    the Minister can tell us today whether the investigation into the shameful allegations
    of Islamophobia experienced by <phrase class="honfriend" name="Nusrat Ghani" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25354">the
    hon. Member for Wealden (Ms Ghani)</phrase> will now be concluded. She was due
    to meet Lord Geidt on the day that he resigned, but the Government have been silent
    on the issue and have failed to say anything about what will happen when any further
    suspected breaches of the ministerial code occur.</p><p pid="b770.1/14">Take,
    for example, reports that the Prime Minister, while Foreign Secretary, tried to
    make an inappropriate appointment to his own office. He reportedly spoke to his
    aides about a taxpayer-funded position&#8212;just another case of dishing out
    jobs to those close to him. Lord Geidt has suggested that such allegations are
    ripe for a new investigation, and I agree. As everyone knows, I love a letter,
    but who should I write the request to? There is no ethics adviser in place to
    hold Tory Ministers to the standards the British public expect. We all know that
    Ministers will not do it themselves. Under this Government, more rule-breaking
    is simply inevitable, unfortunately. Lord Geidt has already said that his role
    was &#8220;exceptionally busy&#8221;.</p>

    Friday agreement, which has brought peace and political stability to Northern
    Ireland. The Northern Ireland protocol is undermining the function of the agreement
    and of power sharing. It has created fractures between east and west, diverted
    trade and meant that people in Northern Ireland are treated differently from people
    in Great Britain. It has weakened their economic rights. That has created a sense
    that parity of esteem between different parts of the community, an essential part
    of the agreement, has been damaged.</p><p pid="d38.3/3">The Bill will address
    those political challenges and fix the practical problems the protocol has created.
    It avoids a hard border and protects the integrity of the UK and the European
    Union single market. It is necessary because the growing issues in Northern Ireland,
    including on tax and customs, are baked into the protocol itself. Our preference
    remains a negotiated solution, and the Bill contains a provision that allows for
    negotiated agreement, but the EU has ruled out up-front making changes to the
    text of the protocol.</p>

    resolute in our commitment to providing legislation that does all it can to deliver
    for those impacted by the troubles. The troubles were a painful period of our
    history, and they are still painful for so many in Northern Ireland. This Bill
    delivers a way forward and delivers on our manifesto pledge. In that spirit, I

  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b157.2/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a
    Second time.</p><p pid="b157.2/2">I am delighted to speak to such an important
    Bill this afternoon, and I hope that hon. and right hon. Members will feel similarly
    about its gravity and weight. This legislation will go a long way towards recognising
    Northern Ireland&#8217;s rich diversity in identity and language, bringing tangible
    benefits for Irish language speakers, Ulster Scots and the Ulster British tradition.</p><p
    pid="b157.2/3">Before I turn to the Bill&#8217;s provisions in more detail, I
    pay tribute to my predecessors as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my
    right hon. Friends the Members for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis) and for North
    West Cambridgeshire (Shailesh Vara), who both championed this Bill. I am very
    pleased to continue their work.</p><p pid="b157.2/4">However, I must temper my
    enthusiasm for the Bill with regret that it is we, as hon. and right hon. Members
    of this House of Commons, who are debating it rather than our counterparts in
    the Northern Ireland Assembly. To be frank, it was never the Government&#8217;s
    intention to introduce the Bill in this Parliament. I explain to those who are
    not aware that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly were both restored
    on <phrase class="date" code="2022-01-11">11 January</phrase> 2020, when all five
    of Northern Ireland&#8217;s main political parties came together on the basis
    of a very good document, New Decade, New Approach, which contained a balanced
    package of measures relating to identity and language. Draft legislation was prepared
    by the Office of the Legislative Counsel in Northern Ireland and published alongside
    New Decade, New Approach for the Assembly&#8217;s consideration. It is therefore
    a matter of enormous regret that the package was not taken forward in a timely
    fashion by the previous Executive.</p><p pid="b157.2/5">I do not intend to relitigate
    those arguments. Instead, I will use this Bill to look to the future. It will
    be the job of a newly constituted Northern Ireland Executive to take forward the
    implementation of this legislation. The provisions of this Bill are based on enshrining
    respect and tolerance for all of Northern Ireland&#8217;s diverse identities,
    cultures and traditions, and indeed celebrating their contribution to Northern
    Ireland.</p><p pid="b157.2/6">We introduced these provisions in the firm belief
    that Northern Ireland&#8217;s rich diversity contributes immeasurably to the Union,
    of which we are proud and to which this Government hold a proud and fundamental
    commitment. We are also taking separate but linked steps when it comes to identity
    and language, steps that reflect this pride in Northern Ireland&#8217;s cultural
    richness and diversity.</p>

    This Order shall be a Standing Order of the House.</p><p pid="b748.2/54">We have
    called this debate to provide the House with the right, which it should have,
    to make the decision on whether fracking should be allowed to restart across our
    country. The Business Secretary made it clear last week that he will not give
    the House a binding vote on the principle of the fracking ban, despite the Conservatives
    overturning their manifesto promise to keep the ban in place, despite the concern
    in all parts of this House and despite the concerns of the public.</p><p pid="b748.2/55">If
    our motion is passed, it will mean that on <phrase class="date" code="2022-11-29">29
    November</phrase>, in six weeks&#8217; time, the House will debate a fracking
    Bill. We have done this because we know what would have happened if we had had
    a simple Opposition Day motion on fracking. The Government would simply have abstained
    and ignored the vote, as they have done in votes on the windfall tax, fire and
    rehire, and the cut to universal credit, and as they will no doubt try to do with
    the motion that has just been passed. This is about faith in politics. The Government
    are seeking to break their manifesto promise without even getting the consent
    of this House. Today, we give all Members a chance to make this crucial decision
    on fracking.</p><p pid="b748.2/56">Now let me go through the substantive arguments
    against fracking. There are four key questions for the House and the country.
    Will fracking make a difference to the price of energy? The answer is no. Is there
    categorical evidence that it is safe? The answer is no. Is  it consistent with
    any remotely serious response to the climate crisis? The answer is no. Crucially,
    do people want it? The answer is no.</p>'

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="b76.0/1">I beg to move amendment (a), Leave out paragraph
    3.</p><p pid="b76.0/2">I appreciate the contribution from the Minister. The amendment,
    which is supported by right hon. and hon. Friends, concerns a particular element
    of the proposal which is of great concern not just to me but to many Members on
    both sides of the House and from different parts of the country. It is, I expect,
    the unintended consequence of the proposal on communities already suffering under
    the weight of excessive second home ownership and the explosion of Airbnbs eating
    up the long-term rented market. There is obviously a debate to be had, which we
    will have next, about the proposal itself, the stamp duty cut, for which there
    are arguments that I fully understand. What I am concerned about is that the cut
    will apply to all properties, including to people buying their second, third,
    22nd or 23rd home. My concern is not because I am consumed by the politics of
    envy, but because I am consumed with concern for my community and many others
    like it.</p><p pid="b76.0/3">Since the pandemic, we have seen the explosion of
    a problem that was already difficult to start with: the rising proportion of second
    homes in communities such as mine. The former Chancellor and soon to be new Prime
    Minister&#8212;I congratulate him&#8212;my constituency neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="None" person_id="unknown">the right hon. Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase>
    (Rishi Sunak), made an error at the beginning of the pandemic when he created
    the temporary stamp duty holiday. The immediate result was that in the first few
    months of the pandemic 80% of all house sales in my constituency, and in communities
    like it, were in the second home market. I hope and assume that was not the intention
    of the former Chancellor and soon-to-be Prime Minister, but that was the consequence.
    Furthermore, we saw a 32% increase in the number of holiday lets during the pandemic,
    up from a huge number to start  off with in the lakes and the dales. That is the
    collapse of the long-term private rented market into the Airbnb market.</p><p
    pid="b76.0/4">I will be trying, by various means, to get the Government to bring
    in new categories of planning use to control excessive second home ownership and
    the collapse of the long-term private rented sector into the Airbnb sector. My
    aim today is to stop the Government making it any worse. If my amendment is not
    agreed to, the Government&#8217;s proposal in the next debate will be to do some
    good things, but also to accidentally do some bad things. That bad thing will
    be to add fuel to the fire of the explosion of excessive second home ownership
    in places such as the lakes and the dales, Cornwall, Northumberland, the Peak
    district and every other part of our country of a similar kind.</p><p pid="b76.0/5">What
    an explosion of second home ownership of this kind means is that our communities
    are robbed of their full-time population. We see people forced out, unable to
    find or afford a home where they can raise their family. We then see footfall
    and demand for local services, such as the local pub, the local post office, bus
    services and local schools, massively reduced as a consequence. We see schools
    closed and communities hollowed out. Not only is it awful, upsetting and utterly
    regrettable to see families forced out of the places they were raised&#8212;I
    deal with these cases, case by case, and see people in extreme housing need because
    our existing housing stock has been gobbled up by second homes and holiday lets&#8212;but
    we also see a material impact on our economy and the consequences for our workforce.</p><p
    pid="b76.0/6">At the moment, Morecambe Bay hospitals have 25% of all beds blocked.
    Why? Because social care is in crisis. Why? Because there is nowhere available
    for anybody who works in social care to be able to live in our communities. I
    can tell the Minister that 63% of all hospitality and tourism businesses in the
    lakes last year had to operate below capacity. Why? Because they could not find
    the staff. Why? Because there is nowhere for those people to live.</p><p pid="b76.0/7">A
    housing crisis that already existed before the pandemic has become a catastrophe,
    in part because of an error made by <phrase class="honfriend" name="None" person_id="unknown">the
    right hon. Member for Richmond (Yorks)</phrase> at the beginning of the pandemic.
    He created a stamp duty holiday that created that boom. My amendment gives the
    Government the ability to do good without accidentally doing terrific harm to
    areas such as the lakes and the dales. It is an opportunity for the Government
    to prove that they do not take rural communities for granted. I hope that the
    Minister will hear what I have to say and act accordingly.</p>'

    Northern Ireland from &#163;125,000 to &#163;250,000. For first-time buyers, the

  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b89.2/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a
    Second time.</p><p pid="b89.2/2">We face challenging times, and challenging decisions
    need to be made, but one thing on which I hope we can all agree is that home ownership
    must remain within reach, and we must support the property market where we can.
    To do that, we are making good our promise to ensure that hard work is rewarded
    and people can keep more of their hard-earned money when they buy a home.</p><p
    pid="b89.2/3">The property industry plays a hugely important role in our economy.
    It is crucial to our growth prospects, and it supports hundreds of thousands of
    jobs and businesses. Home ownership remains one of the surest ways to give people
    a stake in the success of our economy, and we know that stamp duty really affects
    people&#8217;s decisions on whether to buy a property. The Bill confirms a significant
    reduction in the cost of moving home and getting on the housing ladder, which
    will allow more people to buy and to move each year. It will also mean more business
    for painters, decorators, moving companies, plumbers, electricians, and all the
    industries that are reliant on a healthy housing market. More transactions each
    year will mean that more people can move more easily to find work, and that will
    boost labour mobility at a time when people do not need barriers to changing jobs.</p><p
    pid="b89.2/4">Like many Members on both sides of the House, I grew up in a country
    where home ownership was a dream, but an achievable one. It is only right that
    we give those who are now seeking to climb on to the housing ladder a helping
    hand, so that this dream does not slip out of reach. Since 2010, we have helped
    more than 800,000 households to purchase homes through Government-backed schemes
    such as Help to Buy and Right to Buy, and we have made sure that stamp duty land
    tax works for those who wish to get on to and up the property ladder.</p><p pid="b89.2/5">First,
    in April 2016, we introduced the higher rates of stamp duty for those purchasing
    additional properties, which form part of the Government&#8217;s commitment to
    first-time buyers. These rates are 3% above standard residential stamp duty rates.
    The following year, in the 2017 autumn Budget, we introduced first-time buyer
    relief to permanently increase the price at which first-time buyers start paying
    stamp duty. The Government are proud that nearly 700,000 purchases have benefited
    from this relief since its introduction. Because of our action, the annual number
    of first-time buyers is at a 20-year high.</p><p pid="b89.2/6">However, this is
    not just about how we help people purchase within the existing stock of housing;
    we are also boosting investment in home building and affordable housing. In 2019-20,
    nearly 243,000 net additional dwellings were delivered&#8212;the largest number
    in almost 20 years&#8212;and the Government are on track to meet their commitment
    to deliver 1 million additional homes during the current Parliament. In the 2021
    spending review, we also announced &#163;11.5 billion for the affordable homes
    programme to  build 180,000 more of the affordable, quality homes that the country
    needs, including tens of thousands for social rent.</p><p pid="b89.2/7">The Government&#8217;s
    cuts in stamp duty land tax were implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2022-09-23">23
    September</phrase> with immediate effect, and we have introduced the Bill to confirm
    that change. Stamp duty applies to purchases of property or land in England and
    Northern Ireland, with land transaction taxes devolved to Scotland and Wales.
    Devolved Administrations will receive Barnett consequentials for that change,
    in the usual way. The Bill will increase the nil rate threshold, which is the
    level at which stamp duty starts to apply. It will double the threshold at which
    people start paying stamp duty from &#163;125,000 to &#163;250,000, saving a family
    purchasing an averagely priced home &#163;2,500.</p><p pid="b89.2/8">As I mentioned
    a moment ago, in 2017 the Government introduced first-time buyer relief, which
    applied a higher nil rate threshold for purchasers who had never previously owned
    a property as part of our commitment to supporting first-time buyers. The Bill
    will expand the generosity of that relief to ensure that those purchasing their
    first home pay no stamp duty on purchases up to &#163;425,000, up from &#163;300,000.
    The maximum purchase value for which first-time buyers can claim the relief has
    also been increased, from &#163;500,000 to &#163;625,000.</p><p pid="b89.2/9">These
    cuts in stamp duty will mean that an estimated 43% of transactions each year will
    attract no stamp duty whatsoever, up from 25% before the introduction of the Bill.
    No one purchasing a second home or investing in a buy-to-let property will cease
    paying stamp duty, as the 3% surcharge on the purchase of additional dwellings
    will continue to apply. More than half all transactions in the east midlands,
    the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber will attract no stamp duty at all,
    with about six in ten transactions in the north-east having no stamp duty liability.</p><p
    pid="b89.2/10">We are lifting significant numbers of families, first-time buyers
    and home movers out of stamp duty, helping those aspiring to own their own home.
    That means that a couple buying an average home in the east midlands worth about
    &#163;248,000 would otherwise have paid nearly &#163;2,500 in stamp duty, but
    will now pay nothing at all. This measure will directly help people to keep more
    of their hard-earned money. An estimated 90% of those claiming first-time buyer
    relief will now be lifted out of stamp duty entirely. First-time buyers are able
    to access up to &#163;8,750 in relief following the Government&#8217;s changes.</p><p
    pid="b89.2/11">I should make it clear that these changes apply to stamp duty land
    tax, which covers only England and Northern Ireland, but they also mean&#8212;through
    the usual block grant adjustment&#8212;an additional &#163;100 million for the
    devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales.</p><p pid="b89.2/12">The United
    Kingdom has always been a nation of homeowners, and under our plans it will continue
    to be so. We are cutting stamp duty for hard-working people and supporting them
    in getting on to and up the housing ladder. The Bill will reduce the up-front
    costs of moving, it will support the hundreds of thousands of jobs reliant on
    a healthy property market and it will help give people who aspire to home ownership
    the means to make it a reality. For those reasons, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

    and other providers of NHS-funded prescriptions to show, on the patient label,
    the prevailing Drug Tariff value of the items dispensed; and for connected purposes.

    pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require community
    pharmacies and other providers of NHS-funded prescriptions to show, on the patient
    label, the prevailing Drug Tariff value of the items dispensed; and for connected
    purposes.</p><p pid="a177.2/3">I would like to declare that my wife is a community
    pharmacist and, as would be expected, she has offered me some assistance in considering
    this Bill. I would like to thank Mr Gurpal Singh Chaggar of Newington pharmacy
    in Ramsgate in my constituency for his help and support with some of the more
    technical aspects of how the published NHS drug tariff&#8212;amended monthly and,
    for some items, more frequently&#8212;interfaces with software used in all pharmacies.
    I also thank the House of Commons Library, as ever, for its professional assistance,
    which it can always be relied upon for.</p><p pid="a177.2/4">This Bill has the
    benefit of elegance, simplicity and, quite rarely for this place, a cost and administration
    burden as close to zero as any measure could possibly have. Let me lay out the
    framework for the Bill with some facts. In 2021-22 there were 1.14 billion items
    dispensed through NHS England, serving a population of 56 million&#8212;I will
    leave Members to do the maths for how many prescriptions per person that amounts
    to. The cost of the items dispensed, which cover pharmaceutical products and more
    physical appliances and dressings, was &#163;8.7 billion. Just 11% of all prescriptions
    bear the current &#163;9.35 prescription fee. If we look at that the other way,
    89% of all prescriptions are &#8220;free&#8221;, but of course, nothing is free.
    There are a multitude of exemptions&#8212;for example, the over-60s, those in
    receipt of benefits, the under-18s, those in education and those with certain
    medical conditions. We are all familiar with those.</p><p pid="a177.2/5">The prescription
    fees received in 2018-19&#8212;the last year for which the Library could provide
    me evidence&#8212;when the prescription charge was &#163;8.80, were &#163;576
    million. By extrapolation, given that people now pay &#163;9.35 for a prescription,
    I estimate that that figure would be a little north of &#163;600 million today.
    That means that the prescription system is recovering &#163;600 million out of
    an overall cost of &#163;8.7 billion.</p><p pid="a177.2/6">The bulk of prescription
    charges comes from those paying for off-patent drugs, for which the cost price
    may sometimes, marginally, be less than the prescription charge. Such off-patent
    drugs&#8212;often the slightly cheaper generic products&#8212;make up about a
    quarter of all prescriptions in England and include blood pressure drugs, cholesterol-lowering
    drugs, antibiotics, anti-depressants, skin creams, drugs for rheumatism, oral
    contraceptives and analgesics.</p><p pid="a177.2/7">The main purpose of the Bill
    is twofold. Primarily, it will allow everyone in receipt of NHS-provided prescriptions
    to be part of the efficiency measures that the nation needs now, and I think it
    is fair to ask us all to do our bit. For instance, no one keeps a window open
    on a winter&#8217;s day and then heats the room, or throws food away by design,
    so why should it be normal, reasonable and ongoing for perfectly good medication
    to be unused and thrown away?</p><p pid="a177.2/8">The Government are working
    to prevent over-prescribing and assess whether regular medication is still needed
    or appropriate. Pharmacies receive an NHS payment for the medicines use reviews
    that they do and, increasingly, medicines optimisation plans are in place in doctors&#8217;
    surgeries and practices to similarly prevent over-prescribing &#8212;but again,
    that comes at a staffing cost to the system. I will not expand on some of the
    obvious internal systems failures that could easily be addressed, but those in
    the industry are fully aware of them and I recommend that Ministers speak to them.</p><p
    pid="a177.2/9">The Bill would allow patients to play a key part in the common-sense
    optimisation of our resources. My proposal is simple: to use the data field for
    the drug tariff value of the items prescribed, which already exists in the systems
    used in doctors surgeries and pharmacies, to be clearly printed on the patient
    label. That would provide an awareness of the value of often expensive items.</p><p
    pid="a177.2/10">In preparing the Bill, I was not at all surprised by how many
    right hon. and hon. Members approached me to relate their own family stories,
    which follow a similar pattern. On the death of an elderly loved one in particular,
    cupboards and drawers are found to be full of unused drugs that were often issued
    under long-standing, repeat prescriptions and then have to be returned to pharmacies
    for complete and utter destruction and disposal. Those drugs are thrown away&#8212;valueless&#8212;but
    they all bear an initial cost to the NHS budget.</p><p pid="a177.2/11">I attribute
    to older people&#8212;I am getting there&#8212;a great deal of common sense and
    an awareness of value for money. They could be part of the system of medicines
    optimisation by recognising the value of what they are receiving for free and
    by intervening themselves, if necessary, when they see high-value drugs, which
    they know will never be used, simply landing each month. I focus-grouped my plans
    with an older cohort in my constituency and they said that they agree entirely
    with my observations and that they would respond to such a sensible nudge.</p><p
    pid="a177.2/12">The secondary purpose of the Bill is transparency, which is important
    in everything that we do. We accept that freedom of information is a right and
    benefit in the modern UK, so it follows that we should all be aware of the things
    that the state provides through taxpayer funding. Let me be absolutely clear for
    the avoidance of doubt: this is not an attempt to charge; it is a means to achieve
    transparency so that we all appreciate what we get for free, because we know that
    &#8220;for free&#8221; does not exist. Whether it is the provision of NHS services
    or the collection of our household rubbish, there is a cost behind all those transactions
    that we pay one way or another. The Bill aims to shine a light on that at no cost
    and no administrative burden. I hope that hon. Members will see the benefit of
    it and support it as it progresses through the House.</p><p pid="a177.2/13">Question

    House long, because the proposition before it this afternoon is very simple: we
    are asking the House to stand firm in instructing the Chancellor and the Prime
    Minister to honour the triple lock promise and uprate the state pension in line
    with inflation for the next financial year. The motion should not be controversial;
    indeed, every Member should be able to endorse it in the Division Lobby this evening.</p><p
    pid="b123.2/4">The reason we have tabled this motion is that pensioners deserve
    certainty that the promise of protection offered by inflation-proofing the state
    pension will be honoured. Let us remind ourselves of the facts. Pensioner poverty
    is up by 450,000 since 2010. Prices in the shops are up. Energy bills are up.
    The Office for National Statistics found that between June and September this
    year 3.5 million pensioners had already been forced to spend less on food and
    essentials because of the soaring cost of living. Over half of pensioners are
    cutting back on gas and electricity in their homes, and Age UK has projected that
    2.8 million older households are set to be in fuel poverty this winter&#8212;1.8
    million more than in previous years.</p>'

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="b180.2/1">I beg to move,</p><p pid="b180.2/2">That,

    Fareham serving as Secretary of State for the Home Department, this House:</p><p
    pid="b180.2/3">(1) orders that there be laid before this House, within ten sitting
    days, a return of the following papers:</p><p pid="b180.2/4">(a) any risk assessment
    of the Rt Hon Member for Fareham by the Cabinet Office or the Prime Minister&#8217;s

    pid="b180.2/8">(c) the minutes of, submissions relevant to and electronic communications
    relating to, any meeting within the Cabinet Office or the Prime Minister&#8217;s
    Office at which the appointment of the Rt Hon Member for Fareham, or advice relating
    to that appointment, was discussed in a form which may contain redactions, but
    such redactions shall be solely for the purposes of national security; and</p><p
    pid="b180.2/9">(2) recommends that where material is laid before the House in
    a redacted form, the Government should at the same time provide unredacted copies
    of such material to the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament.</p><p
    pid="b180.2/10">It is 15 days since the Prime Minister appointed his new Cabinet,
    and 14 days since it was reported that he had been advised not to reappoint certain
    Ministers, including the Home Secretary and, it was rumoured, the Minister without
    Portfolio, <phrase class="honfriend" name="Gavin Williamson" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24729">the
    right hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Gavin Williamson)</phrase>, to
    their posts on the grounds of standards and of security. Fourteen days in which
    it has been reported that the Home Secretary breached Home Office security arrangements
    not just once but seven times; that she may have also broken insider trading rules;
    that as Attorney General she was investigated several times by leak inquiries;
    that she ignored legal advice on Manston, contrary to her statement to Parliament;
    and that she failed to take the action needed to solve the dangerous overcrowding
    at Manston, leaving her successor and predecessor to pick up the pieces, and that
    she may well have run up a huge legal liability for the taxpayer as a result,
    breaching the ministerial code again in the process.</p><p pid="b180.2/11">It
    has also been reported that the Minister with Portfolio sent abusive texts to
    the then Government Chief Whip, that the Prime Minister was told about this and
    knew the former Chief Whip had put in a formal complaint, and that there are other
    complaints against  the Minister without Portfolio including, most seriously,
    words used towards a civil servant about slitting his throat or jumping out of
    windows&#8212;words that it is reported the Minister with Portfolio has not denied
    using.</p><p pid="b180.2/12">This is in the space of two weeks. Many people have
    been appalled by these appointments, and serious doubts have been raised by many
    Conservative Members who believe standards need to be maintained. The Prime Minister
    promised us that this would be a break from his predecessors, from the favours-for-mates
    culture of <phrase class="honfriend" name="Boris Johnson" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10999">the
    right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson)</phrase> and
    from the chaos of <phrase class="honfriend" name="Elizabeth Truss" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24941">the
    right hon. Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss)</phrase>. Instead,
    the opposite has happened.</p><p pid="b180.2/13">People have been appointed to
    senior jobs in the Cabinet, running the country, not because they can do the job
    or because they will maintain the high standards and security that the Government
    need but because of dodgy political deals. Here is what we know: the Home Secretary
    breached the ministerial code, sent Government documents not only to her private
    email but to other people outside Government who were not authorised to receive
    them, including a Back-Bench Member, his spouse, and someone else entirely by
    accident. She was forced to resign and then, six days later, she was reappointed.</p><p
    pid="b180.2/14">That, in itself, is extremely hard for people outside the Conservative
    party to understand. For a police officer who breached their code of ethics or
    who was responsible for security lapses to the point of being forced to resign,
    or for a civil servant, public appointee or company employee who was found to
    have broken their employment code or security rules to the point of being required
    to resign, the idea that they could be reappointed to that same job just six days
    later is unthinkable&#8212;the idea that somehow, because they had apologised
    in the meantime, six days off is just fine.</p>'

    12 years of economic failure from the Conservatives and 12 weeks of economic chaos,
    we now have this Finance Bill from a party that is holding Britain back. It is
    a Bill from a party that has, of course, lost any claim that it might once have
    tried to lay to economic competence; but more than that, it is a Bill that shows
    a party making the wrong choices time and again, and a party with no plan to grow
    our economy and halt the decline in living standards.</p><p pid="f699.1/4">As
    people across the country know, the Conservatives&#8217; economic failure is hitting
    households hard. We are living through the longest period of earnings stagnation
    for 150 years, with real wages lower this year than when the Tories came to power
    in 2010. Living standards are forecast to fall by 7% over the next two years&#8212;the
    biggest fall on record, taking incomes down to 2013 levels. No wonder the director
    of the Institute for Fiscal Studies described the forecast drop in disposable
    income as &#8220;simply staggering&#8221;. This will truly feel like a lost decade
    for people across the United Kingdom: a decade of low growth, with incomes now
    set to fall back to where they were a decade ago.</p><p pid="f699.1/5">I know
    that Conservative Members are desperate to make out that global factors are entirely
    to blame for the economic reality of today, but although no one denies the deep
    impact of covid and of Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, it is simply not credible&#8212;and
    it is frankly insulting&#8212;to pretend that the occupants of Downing Street,
    now and over the past 12 years, have had nothing to do with the mess that we face.
    It was decisions taken by the Conservatives in office that left us uniquely exposed
    to the inflationary shock of oil and gas prices rising&#8212;they took misguided
    and damaging decisions to shut down our gas storage, to stall on nuclear power
    and to ban renewable technologies such as onshore wind&#8212;and it was decisions
    taken by the Conservatives in office that have denied the UK the opportunity to
    grow our economy over the past 12 years as we could and should have done.</p>'

  question: Question put forthwith (Standing Order No. 62(2)), That the Bill be now

  tidied_motion: I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.
  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="f691.3/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read
    a Second time.</p><p pid="f691.3/2">In the face of challenging global headwinds,
    my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered an autumn statement
    that was honest about the difficult decisions this Government will need to take
    to tackle the cost of living crisis and rebuild our economy. We are not alone
    in dealing with economic problems. One third of the global economy is forecast
    to be in recession this year or next. At the same time, while inflation is high
    in the United Kingdom, it is notably higher in Germany, at 11.6%, in Italy, at
    12.6%, and in the Netherlands,  at 16.8%.</p><p pid="f691.3/3">It is our duty
    to curb rising prices, restore faith in our country&#8217;s economic credibility
    internationally and, ultimately, to deliver growth. The independent Bank of England
    is responsible for controlling inflation. However, as the Chancellor set out in
    the autumn statement, monetary and fiscal policy need to move in lockstep. That
    means, for the latter, taking a disciplined approach and giving the world confidence
    in our ability to pay our debts. We have been clear that we will be following
    two broad principles in this consolidation: first, we ask those with more to contribute
    more; and, secondly, we will avoid the tax rises that most damage growth. With
    just under half of the &#163;55 billion consolidation coming from tax and just
    over half from spending, the autumn statement set out a balanced plan for stability.</p><p
    pid="f691.3/4">Today, we are debating a small number of the tax measures that
    were announced last week. In order to provide certainty to markets and help stabilise
    the public finances, we are taking forward important tax measures in this focused
    autumn Finance Bill, ahead of a fuller spring Finance Bill, which will follow
    the Budget early next year as usual.</p>'

    pid="a803.2/3">I have been advised by the Clerks that this is a very narrow motion,
    so I will stick strictly and exclusively to the matter at hand. Before I come
    to the substantive motion, however, I want to say something to those members of
    the public who may think that this is an arcane or even abstruse issue.</p><p

    to speak in this place, but as the House is pleased to direct me,&#8221;</p><p
    pid="a803.2/6">the Speaker has been the spokesman, champion and protector of the
    Members and institutions of this place, as well as being the impartial arbiter
    of our proceedings. If hon. Members think that that is just a piece of ancient
    history, they ought to consider more recent times. Mr Speaker&#8217;s more recent
    predecessors have been criticised on issues of impartiality or for failing to
    protect Members: for example, Mr Speaker Martin&#8217;s failure to protect my
    right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Damian Green" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10241">the
    Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase> was highly controversial at the time
    and very important.</p><p pid="a803.2/7">As for upholding the rights of Back Benchers
    and Opposition Members, we need only look at Mr Speaker&#8217;s fierce criticism
    of the Government during the statement yesterday, when he upheld our rights. It
    is therefore vital for Members to protect the integrity, impartiality and apolitical
    nature of the Speaker&#8217;s office. That point is clearly recognised in &#8220;Erskine
    May&#8221;&#8212;hardly a polemical document&#8212;at paragraph 15.14, which states
    that</p><p class="indent" pid="a803.2/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;reflections
    on the character of the Speaker or accusations of partiality in the discharge
    of their duties&#8221;</p><p pid="a803.2/9">are a punishable offence. &#8220;Erskine
    May&#8221; also recognises that a Member&#8217;s behaviour and conduct outside
    this House count towards that.</p><p pid="a803.2/10">I turn to the substantive
    motion. Following an appearance by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Nadine Dorries" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11397">the Member for
    Mid Bedfordshire (Ms Dorries)</phrase> before the Select Committee on Digital,
    Culture, Media and Sport while she was Secretary of State, the Committee opened
    an investigation into several claims that she made, but ultimately it decided
    against any action. The Committee as a whole published a special report&#8212;[Interruption.]
    [Hon. Members: &#8220;He&#8217;s turned up.&#8221;] Oh, right.</p><p pid="a803.2/11">The
    Committee as a whole published a special report, which said:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="a803.2/12" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;we may have sought a referral to the
    Privileges Committee but, as her claims have not inhibited the work of the Committee
    and she no longer has a position of power over the future of Channel 4, we are,
    instead, publishing this Report to enable the House, and its Members, to draw
    their own conclusions.&#8221;</p><p pid="a803.2/13">It is crucial in this matter
    to remember that <phrase class="honfriend" name="John Nicolson" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25281">the
    hon. Member for Ochil and South Perthshire (John Nicolson)</phrase> sits on that
    Committee. He did not ask for a Division before the report was published; he did
    not vote against it; he did not publish a dissenting opinion on that report. Instead,
    he wrote to Mr Speaker asking him to give precedence to matters reported on by
    the Committee, even though the Committee itself was not seeking such precedence.
    As would be expected, Mr Speaker did the usual thing, and&#8212;in his own words&#8212;decided
    to</p><p class="indent" pid="a803.2/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;respect the
    Committee&#8217;s assessment of the situation.&#8221;&#8212;[Official Report,

    291.]</p><p pid="a803.2/15">After Mr Speaker had replied to the hon. Member privately,
    as is the convention with privilege issues, the hon. Member took to Twitter. He
    brandished a copy of Mr Speaker&#8217;s letter in his video. He broke all the
    conventions on the privacy of Speakers&#8217; correspondence on privilege, and
    disclosed a partial and partisan account of Mr Speaker&#8217;s letter. He said
    on Twitter:</p><p class="indent" pid="a803.2/16" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;He&#8217;s
    considered my letter, but he&#8217;s decided to take no further action.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="a803.2/17">In doing so, he implied that it was Mr Speaker&#8217;s unfettered
    decision not to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee. Nowhere in his filmed
    statement did he tell his followers that Mr Speaker was following normal procedure
    by accepting the will of the DCMS Committee&#8212;I imagine that is why Mr Speaker
    described his action last week as giving a &#8220;partial and biased account&#8221;
    of the correspondence&#8212;and nowhere in his statement did he tell his followers
    that it was he himself who sat on that Committee and signed off the conclusions.</p><p
    pid="a803.2/18">All of us in this House have a duty to uphold its rules and institutions,
    but by knowingly breaching the confidentiality of the Speaker&#8217;s correspondence,
    the hon. Member has done the opposite. This is a clear breach of our rules. The
    proper response after Mr Speaker&#8217;s censure of him for his behaviour last
    week was for the hon. Member to accept the seriousness of his actions, apologise
    properly to the House, and delete the offending tweets. If he had done so, I imagine
    that would have been the end of the matter; indeed, I would not have made my point
    of order on the day. However, he failed to apologise, and instead compounded his
    misdemeanour. Taking to Twitter once again, he claimed that he</p><p class="indent"
    pid="a803.2/19" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;offered no apology as there was no misrepresentation.&#8221;</p>'

    over the last two weeks to debate the autumn statement and the Finance Bill that
    underpins it. We had extensive and comprehensive questions to the Chancellor when
    he delivered the autumn statement, and we then had two days of debate on the measures
    in the statement. We had Second Reading on Monday and Committee of the whole House
    today. I humbly submit that the House probably does not need to hear any more
    from me about the Bill.</p><p pid="d970.0/3">I will quickly summarise the autumn
    statement. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor was honest about the difficult
    decisions this Government will need to take to tackle the cost of living crisis
    and rebuild our economy. The Finance Bill takes forward important tax measures
    to help stabilise the public finances, to provide certainty to markets and businesses,
    and to support growth. We are legislating rapidly on this small number of measures
    because we are serious about fiscal sustainability, which is essential for stability
    and growth.</p><p pid="d970.0/4">I take a moment to thank colleagues on both sides
    of the House for their scrutiny of this small but important Bill on Second Reading
    and in Committee. I also put on record my thanks to the Bill team in the Treasury,
    to the policy and legal officials across the Treasury, HMRC and the Office of
    the Parliamentary Counsel and, of course, to my private office&#8212;every Minister
    knows the important role our private offices play in supporting the passage of
    any Bill.</p><p pid="d970.0/5">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

    while simultaneously protecting free speech and choice for adults.</p><p pid="d168.0/4">However,
    it is right that the House is allowed to scrutinise these changes in Committee,
    which is why we need to recommit a selection of clauses for a very short Committee
    stage. This will not, as the Opposition suggest, put the Bill at risk. I think
    it is really wrong to make such an assertion. As well as being deeply upsetting

    to play politics with such an important Bill.</p><p pid="d168.0/5">We will ensure
    the Bill completes all stages by the end of this Session, and we need to work

    difficulties, particularly during consideration of the Finance Bill, and I am

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="c790.1/1">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read
    the Third time.</p><p pid="c790.1/2">Our deals with Australia and New Zealand
    are the first trade agreements in almost 50 years that the UK has negotiated from
    scratch. Members from across the House have rightly been eager to engage with
    the Bill, and I thank them all for continuing to do so. I also thank Members who
    sat on the Public Bill Committee for their work in scrutinising the Bill, and
    in particular my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Mark Pritchard"
    person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11946">the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase>
    and <phrase class="honfriend" name="Derek Twigg" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10610">the
    hon. Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase> for their expertise in chairing
    the Committee.</p><p pid="c790.1/3">Members have rightly shown a great interest
    in the Bill, and I would like to use this opportunity to give the House further
    assurances. First, Members expressed concerns about the opportunities that the
    devolved Administrations have had to shape the Bill. I can assure the House that
    our procurement teams have consistently held roundtables with their counterparts
    from the devolved Administrations. During negotiations with Australia and New
    Zealand, they discussed the text of procurement chapters. Discussions on the Bill,
    and the changes in procurement regulations that it creates, have regularly taken
    place. Indeed, during negotiations, ministerial and official level engagement
    on these free trade agreements totals hundreds of hours. That includes 25 meetings
    with the Australia FTA chief negotiator, specific discussions at the ministerial
    forum for trade, and senior official conversations on policy content. My officials
    continue to work closely with their counterparts at the devolved Administrations
    to address the concerns raised regarding the powers in the Bill. I myself have
    also had constructive conversations with Ministers from the devolved Administrations.
    The Government remain committed not to using the concurrent power in the Bill
    without first consulting the devolved Administrations. I want to stress to the
    House that the powers are the most logical and efficient way of making minor,
    technical changes to our procurement regulations.</p><p pid="c790.1/4">On Report,
    we discussed how the Government are committed to providing, for each agreement,
    a monitoring report every two years, and an evaluation within five years   of
    entry into force. The reports will assess the entirety of the agreements and not
    limit themselves to the procurement chapters alone.</p><p pid="c790.1/5">I would
    like to say a couple more thank yous: first, to the Bill team at the Department
    for International Trade&#8212;James Copeland, Donald Selmani, Jack Collins, Alex
    Garcia-Pineiro and Catherine Ajani&#8212;as well as the other officials who make
    up my fantastic team. I would like to thank the parliamentarians who have taken
    part in this and other debates on the legislation, and of course the International
    Trade Select Committee, as well as the wonderful staff here in the House.</p><p
    pid="c790.1/6">I also want to thank the Opposition spokespeople for the constructive
    way in which they have approached scrutiny of the Bill. It was remiss of me earlier
    not to welcome the new SNP spokesperson, <phrase class="honfriend" name="Richard
    Thomson" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25919">the hon. Member for Gordon
    (Richard Thomson)</phrase> to his role, and I do so now. I also thank his predecessor,
    <phrase class="honfriend" name="Drew Hendry" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25382">the
    hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Drew Hendry)</phrase>.
    Who knows, but perhaps under the new leadership we may actually get the SNP to
    vote in favour of a trade deal. [Interruption.] Indeed, I suspected that may be
    the case.</p>'

    we implement the voter identification policy in the Elections Act 2022. This area
    was debated extensively during the passage of the Act earlier this year. Through
    this SI, we will be fulfilling a Government manifesto commitment to protect the
    integrity of our democracy by introducing identification to vote at polling stations.
    Gaps in our current legislation leave open the potential for someone to cast another
    vote at the polling station. Our priority is adopting legislation that ensures
    the public can have confidence in the integrity of our elections and certainty
    that their vote belongs to them, and them alone.</p><p pid="c797.2/4">The introduction
    of a voter identification policy is the best solution to the problem. It has been
    long called for by the independent Electoral Commission, as well as by international
    organisations, such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe,
    which regularly monitors and reports on our national polls.</p>

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="c850.5/1">No, I can assure the hon. Member on that

    is huge consensus is about the duty of care we have to each other. She is very
    genuine, for reasons we all understand, in her remarks.</p><p pid="c850.5/4">I
    would conclude by saying that this is a huge step forward. I thank the Committee
    for its work. It made 20 recommendations, and the Government want 18 of them brought
    in. We want, particularly on ministerial interests, for us to move to the position
    the Committee wants, but in a way that is doable and orderly. This is a free vote.
    All Members will have heard the arguments and listened, and they will be voting
    and deciding what the best thing they think is to do. I do not expect, particularly
    given the subject matter we are debating, any party or Member to criticise the
    decision that hon. Members will have taken this evening in good faith, me included.</p><p
    pid="c850.5/5">With that, I urge all Members to support the Government motion

    provisions of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 relating to the removal of

    or incompatibility with international or other domestic law; to require the Secretary
    of State to proceed with such removals regardless of any decision or judgment
    of any international court or body; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="c1134.2/3">I
    want to start by saying that my thoughts and prayers are with those who have so
    tragically lost their lives while crossing the English channel, as well as with
    their families and our brave emergency service workers who have responded. Today&#8217;s
    awful news makes it clear how we in this place must do all we can to end the vile
    people smuggling and human trafficking gangs that trade in human misery.</p><p
    pid="c1134.2/4">I welcome my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#8217;s announcement
    in the House yesterday that we will begin to fast-track the removal of Albanians,
    speed up the processing of asylum claims, move away from hotels being used in
    places such as Stoke-on-Trent and bring in new legislation in the new year to
    mean that if someone comes here illegally, they cannot stay here, which will help
    to break apart the operating model of these cruel and heartless gangs.</p><p pid="c1134.2/5">The
    people of Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke and I find the number of migrants
    crossing the English channel from perfectly safe, neighbouring European countries
    such as France totally unacceptable and deeply concerning. It is a fact that about
    70% of those making the crossings are young single men coming over on their own.
    Over 12,000 of these are economic migrants from Albania, of whom 10,000 are single
    adult males. We need to bring this national and European emergency to an end,
    as well as to fulfil our promise to the British people by taking back control
    of our laws and borders.</p><p pid="c1134.2/6">When we as a country voted to leave
    the European Union in 2016&#8212;the largest mandate in British political history&#8212;we
    did so to restore our ability to control our laws, money and borders. The people
    of this great country felt that too much power wrongly lay in Europe and that
    their voices were ignored. Leaving the European Union and restoring parliamentary
    sovereignty represented transferring power back to the people who elect their
    Members of Parliament to represent their views.</p><p pid="c1134.2/7">I strongly
    welcomed the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, which was brought to this House
    by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Priti Patel" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24778">the
    Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase>, as a landmark piece of legislation that
    was supposed to seize on our new-found freedoms post Brexit and implement the
    robust and decisive immigration system that the people of this country have been
    so urgently calling for. Along with my Conservative colleagues, I thought it was
    a welcome new approach to the issues of sovereignty and border control. I supported
    the Act because I saw it as a real opportunity to deter people crossing the English
    channel, and therefore to break the harrowing practices of the abhorrent people
    smugglers who operate not just in Europe, but around the world.</p><p pid="c1134.2/8">The
    cornerstone of the Act are measures to offshore to Rwanda illegal economic migrants
    coming from safe mainland Europe, copying the successful model used by Australia.
    Some 73% of my fine constituents in Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke
    support that, based on a survey I have conducted on this issue. Unfortunately,
    the extent to which we can make our own sovereign decisions has been brought into
    question, as immigration lawyers have been able to block deportations to Rwanda
    through appeals to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p><p pid="c1134.2/9">As
    recently as July, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister wrote in The Sunday
    Telegraph that where the European convention on human rights is a problem</p><p
    class="indent" pid="c1134.2/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;I will tackle it. We
    voted to leave so that we could act as a sovereign nation. The ECHR cannot inhibit
    our ability to properly control our borders and we shouldn&#8217;t let it.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="c1134.2/11">According to the National Audit Office report on immigration
    enforcements, only 48% of enforced returns went ahead as planned, due to legal
    challenges emanating from the European Court of Human Rights preventing the other
    52% from going ahead. I agree with the Prime Minister that the European Court
    of Human Rights should not use its political interpretation of our laws to undermine
    the will of the British people. The respondents to my local survey also agree,
    with 68% saying that we should ignore the European Court of Human Rights, as we
    did with the proposal to give prisoners the right to vote.</p><p pid="c1134.2/12">My
    right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="David Davis" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10162">the
    Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> introduced a motion back
    in 2010 on the right of prisoners to vote in general elections. The European Court
    of Human Rights at the time ruled that banning prisoners from voting was a breach
    of their human rights, contrary to decisions made in this House, but my right
    hon. Friend and this House forced the then Government to block it. The purpose
    of my Bill is to move a similar motion in relation to offshoring illegal economic
    migrants, giving us total control over our laws and borders and fulfilling the
    promises we made to the people of this nation in 2019.</p><p pid="c1134.2/13">Personally,
    I think we should seriously consider our position as a member of the ECHR. The
    Centre for Policy Studies report reflects that view, stating:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="c1134.2/14" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;As long as Britain remains a signatory
    to the Convention and bound by the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human
    Rights in Strasbourg, governments will be prevented from adequately enforcing
    immigration laws.&#8221;</p><p pid="c1134.2/15">Although we have left the European
    Union and restored powers back to this House, the democratically elected institution
    that the British people have put their faith in, it should not be blocked any
    further from being able to defend our borders and enforce our laws, such as those
    on processing illegal economic migrants in Rwanda.</p><p pid="c1134.2/16">While
    we may have freed ourselves from EU control, we still have a quasi-legislative
    supranational institution that fundamentally undermines decisions made in our
    democratically elected and sovereign Parliament. That is why I am introducing
    my Bill today. It would mean that we could get the migrants who have entered the
    UK illegally on to flights to Rwanda and, in the future, to other safe countries
    to have their claims processed there, by changing the law to explicitly prevent
    the European Court of Human Rights from meddling in our sovereignty on this specific
    matter. The Bill is about  demonstrating that Parliament is on the side of the
    British public and restoring our great nation&#8217;s territorial integrity. I
    am steadfast in my belief that we can end the ECHR&#8217;s trespass on our parliamentary
    democracy and guarantee this House&#8217;s position as the ultimate lawmaking
    institution of our great country.</p>

    in this country right here, right now. Tomorrow, throughout England and Wales,
    the nurses who saw us through the pandemic will be on strike for a living wage.
    But not in Scotland. Scottish Ministers have negotiated a settlement with the
    trade unions that allows the wages of those on the lowest pay to rise by 11%.
    There will be no strikes by nurses in Scotland tomorrow, and I am pleased about
    that. But let me be clear: we are not satisfied with the situation for our nurses
    and our health service. We want to do more. We want to do better by our nurses.
    We want more of them and we want more investment in our health service. We want
    to build a 21st-century health service based on the wellbeing of our people, rather
    than on fixing ill health. We want to have the choice over whether to raise revenue
    and borrow money to make that happen. To do that, we require the powers of a normal
    independent country.</p><p pid="c1140.2/65">Or take the absurd situation with
    energy supply in our country. We have people looking through the windows of homes
    they cannot afford to heat at wind turbines on the horizon providing abundant,
    cheap renewable energy that they cannot afford to buy because of the ridiculous
    system of energy ownership and regulation in this country. We want the power to
    turn that system upside down and change it forever. But to do that, we need the
    powers of a normal independent country.</p><p pid="c1140.2/66">Thirdly, take the
    debate we had yesterday in this Chamber about migration. We had, to my mind, the
    sordid and unsettling spectacle of the Conservative Benches rammed to the gunwales,
    as Members brayed and cheered on their leader&#8217;s anti-migrant rhetoric. They
    make the case that migrants are not welcome in this country. Well, not in my name
    and not in my country. Migrants are welcome in Scotland, because we need people
    to come and live in our country. We say that not just because we wish to discharge
    our international responsibility to provide security for those who flee persecution,
    but because we know that, if those people come to our country, they will invest
    in our economy and pay their taxes to sustain our public services. Every study
    that has ever been done shows that the net effect of migration is positive, and
    that is why we require the powers of a normal independent country.</p>'

    the wealthiest. We on the Opposition side know where we stand. Labour believes
    that excellence is for everyone&#8212;excellence for every child, in every school,
    in every corner of our country. I ask hon. Members to support that ambition by

    failing to consider the evidence even when their own Members have previously urged
    them to act and, yet again, failing our children.</p>'

    the Third time.</p><p pid="c165.0/2">While I am sure that the House would like
    me to enter back into some of the key arguments at this hour, I think I will for
    the purposes of brevity stick to the main principle at stake here, which is quite
    simply this: in many democratic countries throughout the world, and particularly
    among our European neighbours, we find that strikes are often banned entirely
    in what we would refer to as the blue light services. Yet in this country, the
    only blue light service to have strikes banned was the police in 1919 by a Liberal
    Prime Minister. I know of not a single member of the police who has ever lost
    their job as a result of that sensible restricted right to strike.</p><p pid="c165.0/3">We
    are not proposing a Bill that would prevent people from being able to strike in
    other blue light services or in other areas. We are not doing what we have done
    with the police or with the Army in this country. We are not doing what they have
    done in other European nations or in countries across the world, including Canada,
    Australia and large parts of America. We are not doing any of those things because
    we respect the right to withdraw labour. Rather, through this legislation, which
    I note was receiving large majorities in the House this evening, we are simply
    proposing to protect people&#8217;s lives and to protect people&#8217;s livelihoods.</p><p
    pid="c165.0/4">I ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, how is it that Members in this House
    can look at their constituents and say to them that they should not have the right
    to an ambulance if they have a heart attack, a stroke or a serious illness? Why
    should that be left to a matter of chance, depending on their postcode as to whether
    those vital services turn up? Furthermore, after years of disruption through covid,
    why should our children have to miss school? Why should it be that people who
    work for themselves and rely on their own ingenuity to get their jobs and to take
    home money be denied over months and months the opportunity to get to work? We
    move this Third Reading this evening because we care about people in our workforce
    and their livelihoods and about our constituents and their ability to access vital
    services. That is why I commend this Bill to the House.</p>'

    pay taxes by self-assessment to file their returns and make any payments. In a
    very small number of cases, those tax returns will have been submitted by people
    who are claiming tax benefits because of their non-dom tax status. That loophole
    is well known to some of the current occupants of Downing Street; indeed, some
    of them may still have that status and hope to benefit from it again in future.</p><p
    pid="b278.2/4">The loophole allows a small group of high-income people who live
    in the UK to avoid paying tax on their overseas income for up to 15 years. It
    is a status that can be passed down through people&#8217;s fathers. It costs the
    public finances &#163;3.2 billion a year and it fails to support economic growth
    in the UK. It is a 200-year-old loophole that should have no place in our modern
    tax system.</p>

    and nurses but also cleaning staff, porters, receptionists, radiographers, physios
    and many others who make such a difference to patients’ experience.

    radiographers, physios and many others who make such a difference to patients&#8217;
    experience.</p><p pid="d708.0/2">It is disappointing that, once again, the Opposition
    have used the debate to talk down the NHS and not to recognise the incredible
    achievements and progress made: treating more patients than ever before; working
    on our plans to eradicate cervical cancer; progress for people with HIV, who are
    now able to have a normal life expectancy; reducing stillbirths by 21%; and reducing
    neonatal deaths by 17%. Those are just some of the achievements of our incredible
    staff for patients in this country.</p><p pid="d708.0/3">Anyone listening to Opposition
    Members would think that life under the previous Labour Government was a health
    panacea. When we came into government, MRSA was rife across the NHS, with wards
    and hospitals closed, operations cancelled and patients dying from infection.
    Clostridium difficile was the same&#8212;in 2008, there were 8,300 deaths. Deep
    cleaning was needed across hospitals to keep them open and try to prevent infections.
    The Labour Government&#8217;s pledge to end mixed-sex wards failed; the then Health
    Secretary, Alan Johnson, announced that they had &#8220;got it wrong&#8221; when
    they could not manage it. Elderly women were sharing bays with young men, separated
    by just a curtain&#8212;there was no dignity for patients at all.</p><p pid="d708.0/4">Then
    there was the PFI scandal, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Aaron
    Bell" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25916">the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme
    (Aaron Bell)</phrase> pointed out, with &#163;300 billion of debt for the taxpayer
    for projects worth just &#163;54.7 billion. There was a &#163;26 billion IT scheme
    that never saw the light of day. Undeterred, the Labour leader is now doubling
    down on his &#8220;fit for the future&#8221; plans for the NHS. When Labour was
    last in government, its &#8220;fit for the future&#8221; plans closed hospitals
    up and down the country, with plans to close the Princess Royal in Haywards Heath
    in my constituency. Between 2003 and 2010, in the last six years of the Labour
    Government, 26,000 beds were closed. That was the legacy of the last Labour Government
    for  the NHS.</p><p pid="d708.0/5">There are three precious elements of the NHS.
    There is the building infrastructure, which we are putting &#163;10 billion of
    capital funding into this year&#8212;that is part of the 40 hospitals that we
    are now building to create better infrastructure for the future. We are also introducing
    state-of-the-art facilities, with over 90 rapid diagnostic centres and over 90
    surgical hubs now open. We are eliminating our two-year wait for procedures, and
    are on track to eliminate our 18-month wait from April.</p><p pid="d708.0/6">Of
    course, our staff are the most precious element of all. We are not pretending
    that things are perfect. As <phrase class="honfriend" name="Karin Smyth" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25390">the
    hon. Member for Bristol South (Karin Smyth)</phrase> said, there are pressures,
    backlogs and delays in England, Wales and Scotland. It is pointless to play politics
    with the issues; those are the facts.</p><p pid="d708.0/7">Let me list exactly
    what we are doing now to invest in our staff. We are on track to deliver 50,000
    more nurses across the NHS by next year. We have 38,000 more nurses than in 2019.
    We have record numbers of staff in the NHS, with more than 1.25 million members
    of staff&#8212;41,800 more than a year ago. We have 4,800 more doctors and 10,900
    more nurses. Last year, we had 72,000 people training to be a nurse, 9,000 people
    training to be a midwife and 30,000 people training to be an allied health professional.
    We had a 16% increase in students accepted on nursing and midwifery courses. We
    had 3,400 people starting a degree nurse apprenticeship, earning while they are
    learning and not accumulating student debt. We had student nurses supported with
    a student bursary of &#163;5,000 a year.</p><p pid="d708.0/8">Last year, we had
    over 19,400 non-UK nurses and health visitors joining the NHS. We had 11,600 non-UK
    doctors. We have funded 1,500 more medical places each year&#8212;a 25% increase
    over three years. We have five new medical schools, which are in Tyne and Wear,
    Essex, Kent, Lincolnshire and West Lancashire. We have 7,630 new entrants to undergraduate
    medical courses. We have introduced medical degree apprenticeships. With regard
    to retention, we have suspended until 2025 the rules on nurses who retire and
    the restricted hours that they can do, and we are consulting on removing pension
    barriers.</p><p pid="d708.0/9">We are developing a workforce plan, as set out
    by the Chancellor. We are working with midwives, with Birthrate Plus, on staffing
    ratios in maternity units. We are on track to have 27,000 more mental health workers.
    We are rolling out mental health support teams in our schools. We are introducing
    Oliver McGowan training on autism across healthcare. We have had 3,000 undergraduate
    student dentists over the past few years. We had an increase of 539 dentists providing
    NHS services in the past year. In England, we have 2,500 pharmacists entering
    training each year. We have had a net increase of 1,400 pharmacists a year since
    2016, and we are increasing the number of pharmacy technicians.</p><p pid="d708.0/10">I
    could go on, because that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to our
    investment in our staff. I will take no lectures from Opposition Members, because
    RCN statistics show that Labour-run Wales has 2,900 nurse vacancies and is spending
    &#163;140 million on agency nurses. In fact, the emergency medicines workforce
    census this year says that there is one consultant in Wales for every  7,784 patients
    at A&amp;E. [Interruption.] Opposition Members may laugh, but in Wales there are
    simply not enough staff to cope.</p><p pid="d708.0/11">I will finish by addressing
    Labour&#8217;s non-dom tax plan, which is as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike.
    Labour Members&#8217; non-dom tax plan for transforming the health service would
    raise just &#163;3.2 billion. Not only have they spent that 10 times over, but
    their flagship policy&#8212;the shadow Secretary of State wants to scrap GP partnerships&#8212;will
    cost more than &#163;7 billion, and buying them out and tearing up GP contracts
    will cost &#163;1.7 billion a year. The Opposition are economically illiterate.
    [Interruption.] The shadow Secretary of State has said on the record that he wants
    to abolish GP partnerships. Perhaps he wants to clarify that and say it is not
    what he wants to do, but I do not see him rising to intervene.</p><p pid="d708.0/12">This
    Government will not fall for the fairytale Labour party policies. As I have said,
    we are delivering now&#8212;not in the future&#8212;the many ways in which we
    are increasing our NHS workforce. We are focused on tackling covid backlogs, improving
    our services for patients, and increasing our NHS workforce in England. Let us
    see what happens in Wales with the Labour plans, but we value each and every one
    of the members of the NHS who deliver for patients day in, day out.</p><p pid="d708.0/13">Question

    Labour believes in but, right now, after 13 years of Conservative Government,
    we have none of those things. Our border security has been undermined because

    same period convictions of people smugglers have halved. There has been a massive
    increase in the gangs who are operating along the channel, and a massive drop
    in the number of criminals caught. The Government are still refusing to go after
    the gangs, and the deputy chair of the Conservative party thinks that we should
    not even bother.</p>

    control who comes into this country and the terms on which they remain here. That

    stopping the boats one of his five promises to the British people, and it is why,

  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b369.3/1">I beg to move, That this House disagrees with
    Lords amendments 6B to 6F.</p><p pid="b369.3/2">The Bill is about giving the police
    the tools they need to tackle the highly disruptive protest tactics that we have
    seen in recent months, which have blocked ambulances, delayed passengers making
    important journeys, stopped children getting to school and prevented patients
    from receiving critical medical care. We have seen our capital city, London, being
    held to ransom. It cannot be right that a selfish minority committed to causing
    as much disruption as possible continue to get away with it. These actions are
    not only impacting the public, but diverting the police away from the communities
    they serve; in October and November last year, something like 10,000 hours of
    Metropolitan police time were taken up. That is why the Bill is so important.</p><p
    pid="b369.3/3">We have had some back and forth with the other place, but there
    is now only one remaining issue to resolve between us. It concerns the power to
    stop and search without suspicion, which has been extended through the Bill to
    enable the police to search for and seize articles related to protest activities.
    It is worth saying that, before that power can be exercised, it requires a police
    officer of the rank of inspector or above to have a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; belief
    that a number of offences may be committed in the area concerned. It further requires
    that officer to believe that the conditions being imposed, and the authority to
    carry out these searches, are necessary to prevent the commission of offences.
    Moreover, the power lasts for only 24 hours and is capable of extension for another
    24 hours at the most. Therefore, the power is to be used only where it is reasonably
    suspected an offence may be committed, only where it is believed to be necessary,
    and only for a time-limited period. Those are important restrictions on the way
    the power can be used.</p><p pid="b369.3/4">Stop and search is a vital tool used
    to crack down on crime and protect communities. We see it as appropriate, in the
    face of large, fast-paced environments where it can be difficult for the police
    to reach the level of suspicion required for a suspicion-led stop and search,
    for them to have this power available as well.</p>

    right hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> referred to our progress,
    or lack of progress as he sees it, on reducing debt, before setting out a load
    of spending requests and demands for more support. He wants more energy support
    and more support with the cost of living. He does not want alcohol duty to be
    uprated by RPI, and I understand why he makes that point, but it scores &#163;5
    billion. He cannot have it both ways.</p><p pid="c1103.1/3">Once again, the right
    hon. Gentleman spoke about our relative performance following Brexit. By definition,
    and we can have this debate, our growth compared with  other nations must always
    be an estimate. This is not &#8220;Sliding Doors&#8221;&#8212;my hon. Friend the
    Member for South Thanet mentioned that film&#8212;and there is no parallel universe,
    but there is one area on which we can speak definitively, and that is the saving
    accrued by not paying our membership fee. I can confirm to the House that, net
    of the divorce settlement, &#163;14.6 billion has been made available in the current
    spending review by not having to pay the membership fee. That is an absolute gain
    from Brexit that the Opposition would not have enjoyed.</p><p pid="c1103.1/4">My
    hon. Friends the Members for South Dorset (Richard Drax) and for South Thanet
    and my constituency near neighbour the former Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend
    <phrase class="honfriend" name="Priti Patel" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24778">the
    Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase>, all spoke about corporation tax, and
    my right hon. Friend made the brilliant Conservative point that the Government
    do not create jobs&#8212;she also spoke very well about eastern region entrepreneurialism,
    which I obviously support her on.</p><p pid="c1103.1/5">On the corporation tax
    issue, I would make this key point: we legislated for the increase in 2021 when
    we were still in the pandemic, and one only has to look at the graph for borrowing
    that followed the pandemic, showing the most extraordinary surge, to realise that
    it is impossible to have such a surge in borrowing without fiscal consequences.
    So we had to take difficult decisions. Like my right hon. Friend, I ran a small
    business and I did not enjoy paying corporation tax. As Conservatives we do not
    want to put up taxes, but we also have a duty to run the public finances in a
    sound and stable fashion, so we have taken difficult decisions, but they have
    given us the platform to cut corporation tax in this Budget and Finance Bill for
    businesses that invest.</p><p pid="c1103.1/6">The right hon. Member for Dundee
    East asked about tidal stream energy. We recognise the opportunity of that, which
    is why we are allocating a ringfenced budget for the technology in allocation
    round 5. The hon. Member for Richmond Park complained about our performance on
    inflation relative to the EU; there are 12 countries in the EU with higher inflation
    than us.</p><p pid="c1103.1/7">My right hon. Friend the Member for Witham and
    my hon. Friends the Members for South Dorset and for South Thanet, and I think
    also my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Richard Fuller" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24787">the
    Member for North East Bedfordshire (Richard Fuller)</phrase>, raised a point about
    pillar 2 and sovereignty, and I totally respect the points and arguments they
    make. I reassure them that pillar 2 is implemented through domestic legislation
    in each implementing nation, rather than as an international treaty. The UK has
    a primary right to impose any top-up tax due on UK-headquartered groups or on
    foreign groups&#8217; UK operations. If the UK does not exercise that right, the
    same top-up tax can be imposed by other countries, and businesses would therefore
    incur the same level of top-up tax but the tax would be paid to that nation, not
    to the UK.</p><p pid="c1103.1/8">I said I would respond to <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Catherine McKinnell" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24818">the hon.
    Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase> on childcare.
    As she knows, we are increasing support for those on low incomes. We are increasing
    support for those on universal credit, not least by paying it up front. We will
    be phasing in the childcare support&#8212;from April 2024 working parents of two-year-olds
    can access 15 hours per week. From September 2024 all working parents of children
    aged between nine months and three years can access 15 hours per week. [Interruption.]</p><p
    pid="c1103.1/9">There seems to be a cold going round or something, as there is
    a lot of coughing, so I will conclude by referring to the point of <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Sammy Wilson" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11374">the right hon.
    Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson)</phrase>. He is not in his place but he
    asked an important question, especially in light of our announcement in relation
    to the Windsor framework. I can confirm that the Government have today published
    secondary legislation that will extend full VAT relief for energy-saving materials
    to Northern Ireland. The Windsor framework now enables the relief to be expanded
    to Northern Ireland, with a single UK-wide relief set to take effect from <phrase
    class="date" code="">1 May 2023</phrase>. The relief supports households across
    the UK to improve their energy efficiency. I hope <phrase class="honfriend" name="Jim
    Shannon" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/13864">the hon. Member for Strangford
    (Jim Shannon)</phrase>, who is always present, will relay that back to the right
    hon. Gentleman.</p><p pid="c1103.1/10">To conclude, the Prime Minister has three
    economic targets. We want to halve inflation; this year we are forecast to more
    than halve it, but we know times remain challenging for households. We want to
    get debt down; that is why we are running public finances in a prudent fashion.

  tidied_motion: That this House disagrees with Lords amendments 6H and 6J.
  full_motion_speech: <p pid="b546.3/1">I beg to move,</p><p class="indent" pid="b546.3/2"
    pwmotiontext="yes">That this House disagrees with Lords amendments 6H and 6J.</p><p
    pid="b546.3/3">The Public Order Bill is about giving the police the tools they
    need to tackle the highly disruptive protest tactics we have seen in recent months,
    and indeed today, which have blocked ambulances, delayed passengers making important
    journeys, prevented children from getting to school and patients from getting
    to hospital, and at times held the capital city to ransom. I do not wish to detain
    the House for any longer than necessary, because we have debated this Bill numerous
    times in recent months and it has undoubtedly been given the scrutiny the British
    people want and expect. It is time for that delay to end and for this Bill to
    become law.</p><p pid="b546.3/4">The other place has once more voted to amend
    clause 11, the power to stop and search without suspicion&#8212;although it is
    worth saying that that power can only be used if a police officer reasonably believes
    that certain protest-related offences will happen in the very near future, so
    it is not a power that can be used wholly arbitrarily. It is most disappointing
    to see that vote after this elected Chamber disagreed with their Lordships in
    their last amendments.</p><p pid="b546.3/5">As my noble colleague explained in
    the other place, it is our view that the changes are unnecessary. First, a legal
    framework already exists for all stop-and-search powers. Under section 3.8 of
    Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 code A, the code of practice for powers
    to stop and search, police officers have to give their name or identification
    number, the police station to which they are attached and grounds for every single
    stop and search, essentially replicating the proposal in their Lordships&#8217;
    motion 6H. Those criteria are covered in the GOWISELY mnemonic drilled into every
    police officer.</p><p pid="b546.3/6">Secondly, it is our view that the requirement
    for police forces to establish a charter on the use of powers would cause unnecessary
    burdens on police forces and officers, something the Opposition have been concerned
    about throughout this Bill&#8217;s passage. Plenty of long-established safeguards
    already exist for stop-and-search powers. Additionally, we have supported the
    National Police Chiefs&#8217; Council in its publication of national guidance
    on the use of body-worn video, which includes encouraging forces to share footage
    with external scrutiny groups to support transparency and reflective practice
    and learning.</p><p pid="b546.3/7">On reporting on the use of stop-and-search
    powers, I would like to reassure the House that the Home Office already publishes
    an annual statistical bulletin, which outlines in detail the information gathered
    during each stop-and-search incident. That reporting will be conducted for the
    use of the new stop-and-search powers, both suspicion-led and suspicionless.</p><p
    pid="b546.3/8">Finally, on publishing a statement giving reasons for the use of
    powers, as the Government reiterated in the other place, we recognise that communication
    on  the use of these powers is a fundamental element of building trust and confidence
    between a force and the community it serves. The majority of forces, including
    the Metropolitan Police Service, already communicate their section 60 authorisations,
    and I know that communities appreciate knowing the details of the geographical
    area, time limits and justification for the authorisation. Those forces will continue
    that practice for these new powers.</p><p pid="b546.3/9">Nevertheless, as the
    noble Lord Sharpe of Epsom committed to in the other place, the Government will
    amend PACE code A to require that, where it is operationally practical to do so,
    forces must communicate the extent of the area authorised for the suspicionless
    stop and search, the duration of an order and the reasons for that order. This
    Government commit to the spirit of what their Lordships are asking for, in their
    proposed new subsection (9D) of clause 11, through amendments to PACE code A.
    We will also amend PACE code A to place data collection within the legislative
    framework. It will include a breakdown of both suspicion-led and suspicionless
    searches cross referenced with protected characteristics such as age, sex and
    ethnicity.</p><p pid="b546.3/10">I hope that those clear commitments&#8212;made
    in this House and in the other place, and reiterated here today&#8212;will satisfy
    hon. Members. Making changes to PACE code A is the right way to address those
    issues. The amendments to PACE code A will ensure consistency across all stop-and-search
    powers and allow for a full and robust consultation with external stakeholders,
    providing the right balance between tackling disruptive protesters and protecting
    the rights of each citizen where the powers are used. For those reasons, I hope
    that the House will agree with the Home Secretary in respectfully disagreeing
    with their Lordships&#8217; amendments 6H and 6J.</p>

  tidied_motion: “an impact assessment of sewage discharges;”
  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="c604.9/1">I beg to move an amendment, to leave out
    from</p><p class="indent" pid="c604.9/2" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;an impact assessment
    of sewage discharges;&#8221;</p><p pid="c604.9/3">to the end of the Question.</p><p
    pid="c604.9/4">The public are rightly disgusted by the excessive sewage discharges
    from storm overflows, and so am I, my colleagues on the Government Benches and
    hon.  Members across the House. So are this Government. That is why we have taken
    more action than any other Government on the issue.</p><p pid="c604.9/5">We created
    our storm overflow discharge plan, with an impact assessment showing that it will
    require the largest ever investment by the water industry, up to &#163;56 billion.
    Last month we set out our new comprehensive, integrated plan for water. That will
    deliver a clean and plentiful supply of water for people, businesses and nature,
    building on the significant investments and progress already made in cleaning
    up our waters since 2010.</p><p pid="c604.9/6">Nearly three in four beaches are
    rated excellent for bathing, which is up from just half in 2010, when Labour left
    power. We have taken on the micro and single-use plastics that are a plague for
    marine life; we are supporting the super-sewer in London, which is taking over
    10 years to construct; and there is consistent action, right across the country,
    on cleaning up our waters. That is why we are seeing much-loved species, such
    as seahorses, otters and seals, returning to our rivers and seas.</p><p pid="c604.9/7">By
    requiring water companies to start monitoring, we unveiled the scourge of sewage.
    It was a Conservative Minister, Richard Benyon, who ordered that. By the end of
    this year, not by 2030, all combined sewer overflows will have monitors. Informed
    by monitoring, we are now in the situation where the water companies are under
    active criminal and civil investigation by the Environment Agency and by Ofwat,
    which is the largest investigation ever. That is why I move the amendment in my
    name and that of the Prime Minister, because this Government have already taken
    action.</p><p pid="c604.9/8">With regard to this motion, we already have a target
    for a reduction in sewage discharges, which we will put into law; we have already
    consulted to remove caps on financial penalties; and we have already undertaken
    an assessment of sewage discharges. However, unlike the Opposition, we have a
    credible, costed plan to stop the scourge of sewage.</p><p pid="c604.9/9">Today
    we have already heard a barrage of blame and finger pointing, but we have not
    heard a credible, costed plan to tackle the issue. I am used to the personal attacks,
    the diatribes and the cheap shots, but I can tell hon. Members that Labour&#8217;s
    plan is not cheap. My parents lived in Frodsham for some time, so I am very conscious
    of the River Weaver, and I grew up in Liverpool, so I am very conscious of the
    River Mersey, which has got cleaner and cleaner over time thanks to ongoing continued
    investment.</p><p pid="c604.9/10">Frankly, we should be having a grown-up debate
    about the issue. A lot of the plan set out by the shadow Secretary of State is
    pointless because it is already being done. We were talking about food, and I
    guess the hon. Gentleman has taken up growing magic mushrooms: the Opposition
    did not publish the data, they were not monitoring it, they kept people in the
    dark and they fed them BS for all the time they were in government.</p>'

    to progress Labour&#8217;s Bill, the Water Quality (Sewage Discharge) Bill, which
    would finally see an end to the Tory sewage scandal. The reason we are here today
    is that the country we love, and the quality of life for millions of working people,
    is being treated with utter contempt: dumped on with raw human sewage; dumped
    on on an industrial scale; dumped on with at least 1.5 million sewage dumps last
    year alone; and dumped on for a total of 11 million running hours. That is a sewage
    dump every two and a half minutes. Just in the course of this debate, 70 sewage
    dumps will take place in the country, in the places where people have invested
    everything they have, where they have put down their roots and where they have
    invested the most precious of things&#8212;their families and shared futures.
    Those sewage dumps are going into the seas where people swim, the canals alongside
    which people take their dogs for a walk and the very beaches where our children
    build sandcastles.</p>'

  tidied_motion: That this House condemns successive Conservative Governments for
    their mismanagement of the economy over 13 years; regrets that this has resulted
    in the UK being the only G7 economy that is still smaller than before the pandemic,
    with squeezed wages and higher mortgage rates that have increased costs by £500
    a month for some households; further regrets that successive Chancellors have
    made working people pay for the Government’s economic failure with 24 tax rises
    since 2019, creating the highest tax burden in 70 years, while refusing to abolish
    the non-domicile tax loophole; is extremely concerned about the impact on household
    budgets of an inflation rate of more than 10 per cent with food prices rising
    at their fastest rate in 45 years; therefore calls on the Government to ease the
    cost of living crisis by freezing council tax this year, paid for by an extended
    windfall tax on oil and gas company profits; further calls on the Government to
    cut business rates for small businesses and support energy intensive industries
    including food manufacturers with their energy bills to help bring down the cost
    of everyday items; and finally calls on the Government to adopt Labour’s economic
    mission to secure the highest sustained growth in the G7 with good jobs in every

  question: Before I put the Question, I am sure that the Whips Office and those on
    the Treasury Bench will appreciate that concern has been expressed that the Minister
    who opened the debate is not here for the closing speeches, and I believe attempts
    are being made to find out what has happened. I assure colleagues that that will
    be pursued. I just give a reminder for those who wish to participate in the next
    debate that it is important to get back in good time for the Opposition wind-up
    as well as for the Minister’s wind-up, and one way to achieve that is to stay
    for most of the debate, rather than disappearing off for long periods. Question
    put.

    system which he has acknowledged is an unfair form of property ownership; calls
    on him to keep his promise to the millions of people living in leasehold properties
    by ending the sale of new private leasehold houses, introducing a workable system
    to replace private leasehold flats with commonhold and enacting the Law Commission’s
    recommendations on enfranchisement, commonhold and the right to manage in full;
    and further calls on the Secretary of State to make an oral statement to this

    but it is not just a market&#8212;it is a fundamental human right. But for so
    many people in our country, what they thought would be the reward of years of
    hard work and the realisation of their dreams of home ownership are shattered
    by the reality of what it means to be a leaseholder.</p>

    the public, parents, school staff and children learned&#8212;not from a ministerial
    statement in this House but from a document leaked to The Observer&#8212;that
    many school buildings in England are in such a state of disrepair that they are
    a risk to life. It has been a full year and still the Government have not shared
    information with parents and the wider public about which schools, which buildings,
    and how much of a risk to life. Labour has tabled this motion to require Ministers
    finally to be up front with school staff, parents and pupils about the true state
    of our school buildings, the extent of disrepair, and their neglect over the last
    13 years. Conservative MPs will have the opportunity to vote with Labour in the
    public interest and to do what is right by their constituents.</p><p pid="d221.2/4">I
    am sure that the Minister will point to the condition improvement fund announced
    yesterday. At the third time of asking, a school in my constituency has finally
    received some funding so that it can at least comply with legal requirements on
    the boiler and the drains. Enabling schools to comply with legal requirements
    that the Government set out should be an absolute basic, but it has taken three
    rounds of bidding to get to that stage. I know that Members on both sides of the
    House will have had exactly the same experience.</p><p pid="d221.2/5">The parlous
    state of school buildings is a national disgrace. It is shameful, and it comes
    from a Government and a Department who have given up on ambition for our children.
    They have given up on openness, given up on accountability, given up on standards
    and given up on improvement. It comes from a Government whose failed Schools Bill
    had little to offer schools other than ridiculous micromanagement from Whitehall.
    A Government who are out of ideas and short on ambition. A Government whose poverty
    of ambition has been failing our children for 13 long years. That poverty of ambition
    stretches far beyond the buildings themselves and right across our country, right
    over the course of lives and right over the whole of our education system.</p>

    Just Stop Oil has carried out 156 slow marches around London. That has required
    more than 13,770 police officer shifts. That is more than 13,000 police shifts
    that could have been spent stopping robbery, violent crime or antisocial behaviour,
    and the cost to the taxpayer is an outrage, with &#163;4.5 million spent in just
    six weeks, on top of the &#163;14 million spent last year. In some cases the protests
    have aggravated the public so much that they have taken matters into their own
    hands. They have lost their patience. The police must be able to stop this happening
    and it is our job in government to give them the powers to do so.</p>

    which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for South Swindon first introduced
    to the debates on this Bill some two debates ago. She mentioned friction and made
    a complaint about Back Benchers, but the suggestion of friction came from a Back
    Bencher, as I mentioned in my opening speech.</p><p pid="c839.0/4">The hon. Lady
    says there is a failure to listen, but I disagree. There is a lot of listening
    and there is a disagreement. It is not the same. One can listen and one can still

    and learned Friend the Member for South Swindon, I am grateful to him for his
    words. I agree with him that the example he gave, of 60 sitting days starting
    in July, is a significant period of time. I am afraid he and I will not agree
    entirely on that, and he will not be surprised by that. I encourage him to look
    at schedule 5 and the sifting Committee. I know he understands the point and he
    heard my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Andrew Jones" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24758">the

    I simply repeat to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for South Swindon
    that our concern with the approach is that, by adding such a significant amount

    across the House share that desire, as do their constituents, and that many of
    them are not comfortable about being in this position, whereby a Bill that they
    had supported was withdrawn by their Government. This is also about holding the
    Tory Government to account for not delivering on their manifesto promises, because
    we believe that promises should be kept.</p><p pid="c849.5/60">Of course, Labour
    is and always has been the party of animal welfare. The last Labour Government
    left a proud legacy of delivering on promises to protect animals. We banned experiments
    in the UK on great apes such as chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas in 1997.
    A Labour-led Home Office ended licences for testing cosmetics on animals in 1998.
    Labour established the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction
    of Animals in Research, and led the way on research on alternatives to animal
    testing, and Labour ended cruel fur farming in England and Wales by introducing
    the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000. Despite vociferous opposition from the
    Conservatives, Labour made it illegal to hunt wild animals with dogs in England
    and Wales, passing the groundbreaking Hunting Act 2004. It was also Labour who
    stopped the use of drift nets and so helped to protect dolphins, sea birds and
    other marine animals. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Ben
    Bradshaw" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10061">the Member for Exeter (Mr
    Bradshaw)</phrase> introduced the landmark Animal Welfare Act 2006, which finally
    called time on mutilations such as the docking of dog tails, and made owners and
    keepers responsible for ensuring the welfare of their animals. We can also be
    proud of our record on halting the decline of farmland birds while increasing
    rare and woodland bird populations and, in 2009, it was the Labour Government
    and Labour MEPs who worked to secure an EU-wide ban on the commercial trade in
    seal products.</p>'

    in my name, and the name of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition
    and others. We tabled it because Britain is a nation of animal lovers who rightly
    demand world-leading standards and protections; I know that many Members from
    across the House share that desire, as do their constituents, and that many of
    them are not comfortable about being in this position, whereby a Bill that they
    had supported was withdrawn by their Government. This is also about holding the
    Tory Government to account for not delivering on their manifesto promises, because
    we believe that promises should be kept.</p><p pid="c849.5/60">Of course, Labour
    is and always has been the party of animal welfare. The last Labour Government
    left a proud legacy of delivering on promises to protect animals. We banned experiments
    in the UK on great apes such as chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas in 1997.
    A Labour-led Home Office ended licences for testing cosmetics on animals in 1998.
    Labour established the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction
    of Animals in Research, and led the way on research on alternatives to animal
    testing, and Labour ended cruel fur farming in England and Wales by introducing
    the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000. Despite vociferous opposition from the
    Conservatives, Labour made it illegal to hunt wild animals with dogs in England
    and Wales, passing the groundbreaking Hunting Act 2004. It was also Labour who
    stopped the use of drift nets and so helped to protect dolphins, sea birds and
    other marine animals. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Ben
    Bradshaw" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10061">the Member for Exeter (Mr
    Bradshaw)</phrase> introduced the landmark Animal Welfare Act 2006, which finally
    called time on mutilations such as the docking of dog tails, and made owners and
    keepers responsible for ensuring the welfare of their animals. We can also be
    proud of our record on halting the decline of farmland birds while increasing
    rare and woodland bird populations and, in 2009, it was the Labour Government
    and Labour MEPs who worked to secure an EU-wide ban on the commercial trade in
    seal products.</p>'

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="c165.2/1">I beg to move,</p><p class="indent" pid="c165.2/2"
    pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to prohibit the promotion
    of social transition practices in schools; to require schools to inform parents
    if their child has indicated an intention to pursue, or has commenced, social
    transition; to provide for a right for parents to access information about lessons
    in schools; to make provision about the teaching of the concept of gender identity
    in schools; and for connected purposes.</p><p pid="c165.2/3">The issue that I
    bring to the House today needs a Bill, the very necessity of which is both grotesque
    and revealing of an absurdity: the turning of a blind eye to the real-world effects
    that seemingly good-faith legislation has had on our education system, on schools
    and on society as a whole.</p><p pid="c165.2/4">So that we can all be clear about
    what the proposed Bill refers to, let me start by defining the terms that it mentions.
    &#8220;Gender identity&#8221; is the theory that, although we may be biologically
    male or female, the more important characteristic is what we actually feel like
    on the inside. &#8220;Social transitioning&#8221; is the conscious act of self-rejection
    of our biological reality.</p><p pid="c165.2/5">Cases of that happening used to
    be one of the clearest examples we had ever seen of an exception that proves the
    rule, but I am sickened to say that, under all our noses, members of society who
    are either politically or educationally tasked with helping to bring up our children
    have turned raising the next generation into a science experiment, with consequences
    that break my heart.</p><p pid="c165.2/6">In schools today, it is rapidly becoming
    taught that it is a normal and common experience not to feel at home in our own
    bodies, and that the reason we feel like that is likely to be because we, as a
    person, are simply trapped in the body of the opposite sex. In some schools, one
    in 15 children now identify as something different from their actual biological
    sex.</p><p pid="c165.2/7">The exceptions that proved the rule are now becoming
    the rule. We have started to blur the lines of basic reality, and have turned
    what was already an extremely complex world for children to get to grips with
    into a more complex one. To paraphrase Douglas Murray, there is just about nothing
    more formative to our grip on reality than the realities of sex. The first, most
    basic, most instinctive thing we become aware of when we are growing up or even
    meeting someone new is simply that there are boys and there are girls. In dismantling
    that, we dismantle the world and pull out a foundational block of society. Who
    knows where the Jenga tower may fall? But one thing is certain: the tower will
    fall, and we should all be ashamed that we would doom our children to such a fate.</p><p
    pid="c165.2/8">Social transition practices in schools have now become the norm
    in every classroom in the country. They are promoted as a normal and healthy response
    to natural feelings that children experience during the difficult period that
    we used just to call &#8220;growing up.&#8221; There is not a single child in
    our schools today who has not been exposed to these practices. They include the
    policing of language by mandating the use of a child&#8217;s preferred pronouns&#8212;referring
    to a boy as &#8220;she&#8221; or &#8220;her&#8221; instead  of &#8220;he&#8221;
    or &#8220;him&#8221;, or vice versa&#8212;and the use of body alterations to reflect
    a transition to the opposite sex, which primarily take the form of surgical castration
    for boys, double mastectomies for girls, Frankenstein-esque genitalia being created
    from grafts of skin, and drugs to pause or halt puberty. Teachers, students or
    even parents who do not oblige are punished and ostracised. In Canada, calling
    a child by their &#8220;wrong pronoun&#8221; is already a crime.</p><p pid="c165.2/9">The
    common consensus is that this gender-based ideology came from adolescents who
    are more inclined to adopt so-called progressive and liberal values, but that
    could not be further from the truth. The origins of gender ideology came from
    rogue academics in the 20th century who have since been discredited, laying the
    groundwork for future socialist thinkers to start making more and more wild claims
    about the nature of our societies.</p><p pid="c165.2/10">George Bernard Shaw was
    one of those who opened Pandora&#8217;s box by coining anti-family rhetoric and
    promoting the rejection of societal gender norms. In 1928, Shaw wrote:</p><p class="indent"
    pid="c165.2/11" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;The social creed must be imposed on
    us when we are children&#8230; It is quite easy to give people a second nature,
    however unnatural, if you catch them early enough.&#8221;</p><p pid="c165.2/12">Those
    are chilling words, yet here we are, voluntarily following his playbook.</p><p
    pid="c165.2/13">This did not come from our children spending more and more time
    in the echo chamber of social media; it has been clinically and systematically
    imposed on them from the top down. Gender ideology is a political ideology&#8212;one
    that is being, effectively, promoted in schools, and that therefore constitutes
    political indoctrination, which, under section 406 of the Education Act 1996,
    is strictly prohibited.</p><p pid="c165.2/14">Any who would argue that gender
    identity is protected by the Equality Act 2010, and can therefore be discussed
    in schools, would have grossly misinterpreted the Equality Act, as gender identity
    is not a protected characteristic. There is a reason why we are careful what topics
    we broach with children and teach them at young ages. Why have we forgotten that?</p><p
    pid="c165.2/15">If it were at all possible, it gets much worse. The public are
    rightly shocked when they learn just how graphic and extensive sex education lessons
    have become in our schools. Five-year-olds are being taught to identify different
    genitalia in class. Nowhere in the guidance on sex education lessons does the
    Department for Education discuss nine-year-old children being taught about masturbation
    or witnessing dolls simulate sex acts, or 11 to 12-year-olds being taught that
    they can feel pleasure from anal or oral sex. Does this depravity know no bounds?</p><p
    pid="c165.2/16">Not only are these topics being broached, but pre-pubescent children
    are being encouraged to explore their own bodies in this manner. It borders on
    criminality when adults are suggesting that children as young as eight should
    engage in adult activities. We have a duty to safeguard our children, preserve
    their innocence and protect them from the complexities of adult life until they
    reach an appropriate age, when they are mature enough to engage with topics and
    fully understand them.</p><p pid="c165.2/17">What is happening in our schools
    is unacceptable, and there is a need for immediate action. Classrooms should be
    a safe harbour. Inclusivity has become a  double-edged sword, cutting through
    the very fabric of childhood. Every child has the right to innocence and immunity
    from the sexual perversions of adults.</p><p pid="c165.2/18">When teaching sex
    education&#8212;a topic where a bridge should stand between parents and teachers&#8212;a
    barricade has formed. Parents have been left in the dark and even actively blocked
    from seeing the material taught to their own children. We must act now and hope
    that the damage already done will not be too long-lasting.</p><p pid="c165.2/19">The
    Bill I propose today will prop up existing legislation aimed at protecting our
    children and put an end to this dark chapter. Social transition in children will
    be forbidden. The promotion of social transitioning and the discussion of social
    transitioning practices will be prohibited from appearing in any aspect of a school
    curriculum. Local authorities, governing bodies or headteachers shall immediately
    inform parents or carers of any child who indicates intent to socially transition
    or who has commenced the process of socially transitioning. Moreover, when the
    parents of a child who has considered socially transitioning have been informed,
    the relevant safeguarding policies shall be adhered to and the relevant safeguarding
    leads shall be notified.</p><p pid="c165.2/20">Parents will be entitled to the
    right to consultation, the right to withdraw their children from sex education
    and the right to have access to the materials used as part of that sexual education.
    Schools will only be allowed to use published, citeable resources that are reliably
    available for public and regulatory scrutiny. The Bill will uphold and reinforce
    the provisions laid out in the Education Act 1996 and will forbid the promotion
    of gender identity. Where gender identity is taught, it will be taught alongside
    opposing views to allow for a fair presentation of political beliefs.</p><p pid="c165.2/21">Relationships
    and sex education lessons and personal, social, health and economic education
    lessons were brought in to sensibly and safely inform our children about topics
    necessary to keep them safe from harm. Let us get a grip of the legislation and
    deliver on the original intended purpose. Our children are not guinea pigs; it
    is high time that this House took charge and stopped allowing ideologies passed
    down from mad scientists that treat them as such. My proposed Bill will protect
    children, reassure parents and offer certainty to teachers. I wish with all my
    heart that it was not necessary, but it is needed&#8212;and it is desperately
    needed.</p>'

  question: To inform the House, I shall put the main Question first. Should it be
    negatived, I will then put the Question on the amendment. Question put (Standing
    Order No. 31(2)), That the original words stand part of the Question.
  tidied_motion: “welcomes the Government’s drive to halve inflation, grow the economy
    and reduce debt; particularly welcomes the Government’s new Mortgage Charter which
    has been agreed by 85 per cent of the residential mortgage market and will provide
    support to mortgage holders through new commitments and flexibilities to help
    borrowers who are anxious about rising interest rates; notes the extensive package
    of cost of living support to help families with rising prices, worth an average
    of £3,300 per household including direct cash payments to the eight million most
    vulnerable households; and further believes that Labour’s policies to manage the
    economy would be inflationary, lead to higher interest rates and put more pressure
    on mortgage holders and renters.”

    two decades of low inflation, the world has been confronted with a bout of fast-growing
    prices, and we are not alone. As a result of rising prices, central banks around
    the world, including in the United States, Japan, New Zealand and the European
    Union, have been raising interest rates in order to force down the rate of price
    rises. As all Members will be aware, last week, the Bank of England&#8217;s independent
    Monetary Policy Committee raised rates to 5%. Let me say at the outset that the
    Bank of England and its Monetary Policy Committee has the full support and confidence
    of this Government, and will continue to do so as it takes whatever action is
    necessary to return inflation to the 2% target in the medium term. As the Chancellor
    was clear when addressing this place yesterday, he will not take action that undermines
    the Bank of England&#8217;s monetary objectives.</p>

  question: Question put forthwith (Standing Order No. 31(2)), That the proposed words
    be there added.
  tidied_motion: That this House is extremely concerned that, under this Conservative
    Government, average mortgage costs will be increasing by £2,900 per year, with
    a typical household in the UK paying over £2,000 more per year than in France
    and over £1,000 more than in Ireland and Belgium, and that renters face huge increases
    in rent payments; condemns the Government for its slowness in acting to support
    millions of homeowners and renters and so alleviate the impact of its policies;
    calls on the Government to bring in mandatory measures, as the current voluntary
    measures could lead to around one million homeowners missing out on support, and
    to immediately adopt measures to ease the mortgage crisis and halt repossessions
    by guaranteeing support from lenders for struggling mortgage borrowers and strengthening
    the rights of renters; in particular calls on the Government to require lenders
    to allow borrowers to switch to interest-only mortgage payments for a temporary
    period, to lengthen the term of their mortgage period, to reverse any support
    measures when requested and to make mandatory repossession restrictions; and further
    calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to instruct the Financial Conduct Authority
    to urgently issue guidance that the credit score of borrowers should be unaffected
    by any temporary switches to interest-only mortgage payments or lengthening of
    their mortgage period and to introduce a renters’ charter that would end no-fault
    evictions immediately.

    Britain, families are experiencing the harsh, rolling impacts of the Tory mortgage
    bombshell. Last autumn, the Tories&#8217; mini-Budget crashed the pound; they
    trashed our economic institutions and left our country&#8217;s reputation in tatters,
    with higher mortgage rates as the consequence. The current Prime Minister and
    the latest Chancellor have not turned the situation around. For families across
    Britain, things are getting worse, not better. The Prime Minister is now lecturing

    recognise the Secretary of State&#8217;s very touching words on Lord Kerslake.
    He was Lord Kerslake to some, but Bob to those of us who have benefited over many
    years from his ceaseless encouragement and  advice. His knowledge of central Government
    and local government was unparalleled. His commitment as a genuine public servant
    who cared deeply about people will be badly missed. He was taken from us too soon,
    and I would like to add our voice to the very touching tribute from the Secretary
    of State.</p><p pid="b595.4/4">It is perhaps in the spirit that Bob would have
    wanted that I approach the Bill&#8212;on a note of consensus, on something that
    ought to be a matter of consensus for Labour Members. I recognise that there are
    deeply held feelings about these issues, and I want to acknowledge that Members
    in this debate must be heard. I shall, of course, welcome interventions, but I
    will seek to balance that with the need of Members on both sides of the House,
    whether I disagree with them or not, to make their views known.</p><p pid="b595.4/5">I
    want to begin by saying to the Secretary of State that we recognise the problem
    which he says the Bill is designed to tackle. It is therefore deeply frustrating
    that the Government have introduced a Bill that is needlessly broad, with sweeping,
    draconian powers and far-reaching effects. Instead of Members on both sides of
    the House having the opportunity to come together and welcome long-overdue action,
    he faces genuine, legitimate, heartfelt opposition from Conservative Members;
    from groups who face persecution, such as the Uyghur, who thought that we stood
    with them; from human rights groups; and from local government. I have watched
    the Secretary of State lose Government Members because of the tone that he has
    struck in the debate. I hope that as the debate progresses he will listen to some
    of those concerns.</p><p pid="b595.4/6">I say to the House that it does not have
    to be this way. It is not, in our view, wrong for public bodies to take ethical
    investment and procurement decisions. In fact, there is a long history of councils,
    universities and others taking a stance in defence of freedom and human rights.
    In the case of elected councils, their electors often expect them to do just that.
    There is a difference between legitimate criticism of a foreign state&#8217;s
    Government and what some individuals and organisations have tried to do in recent
    years, which the Secretary of State outlined well. To seek to target Israel alone,
    to hold it to different standards from other countries, to question its right
    to exist, to equate the actions of the Israeli Government with Jewish people,
    and in doing so create hate and hostility against Jewish people here in the UK
    is completely wrong.</p><p pid="b595.4/7">There is at least one example of a publicly
    funded body that has taken a stance against the state of Israel that has effectively
    cancelled Jewish culture here in the UK. We will always stand against that. Most
    public bodies would not dream of behaving like that, but even one incident has
    unacceptable and far-reaching consequences for the Jewish community, increasing
    hate and hostility at a time when antisemitic attacks have reached a peak, children
    learn behind gates, and security guards stand outside synagogues.</p>

    tribute to Lord Kerslake, who, as the House will know, died over the weekend after
    a short illness. Bob Kerslake was a true public servant, steeped throughout his
    professional life in local and central Government, and wholly dedicated throughout
    his career to improving the lives of citizens. He began his career with Greater
    London Council and went on to run, with distinction, Sheffield City Council&#8212;the
    fourth largest in England&#8212;before making the switch to the corridors of Whitehall.
    He was the first chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, the forerunner
    to Homes England, a vital arm of Government in making sure that affordable housing
    is available to all. He was deservedly promoted to become permanent secretary
    to the Department for Communities and Local Government and, later, head of the
    home civil service, where he served with great distinction and kindness. Speaking
    personally as a Minister in the Governments where he served, I was deeply grateful
    to Bob for his dedication, his generosity of spirit and his wise advice.</p><p
    pid="b586.3/3">After leaving Government, Bob led the inquiry into the 2017 Manchester
    Arena bombing. More recently, he chaired the UK2070 Commission on regional inequalities.
    My colleagues and I greatly valued his work on homelessness with the Kerslake
    commission, and I think we all agree that his energy, knowledge and wisdom will
    be greatly missed. I know that right hon. and hon. Members across the House will
    wish to join me in sending our deepest condolences to his family in their grief.

    for the UK Government; it ensures that local authorities concentrate on serving
    their residents, not directing resources inefficiently; and, critically, it provides
    protection for minority communities, especially the Jewish community, against
    campaigns that harm community cohesion and fuel antisemitism.</p><p pid="b586.3/5">In

    craven pandering to what has become the Government&#8217;s electoral base, and
    to those elements on their Back Benches who have been returned to this House by
    that electoral base, the Government seem increasingly prepared to walk away from
    or even rip up conventions and treaties that past Conservative Governments and
    Ministers once had a hand in drafting. Once again, they are using their majority
    to simply override the considered proposals from a House of Lords that they nevertheless
    want to continue to pack with their donors, cronies and assorted time-served loyalists.</p><p
    pid="e248.1/3">Among those amendments was yet another Dubs amendment, Lords amendment
    8, under which unaccompanied children would essentially continue to have the right
    to claim asylum in the United Kingdom and the Home Secretary would not be able
    to declare them inadmissible. That is what the Home Secretary wants to be able
    to do&#8212;to declare young children inadmissible for asylum and leave them essentially
    in a kind of limbo in the UK until they are old enough to be sent back to where
    they came from, or perhaps to Rwanda or anywhere else that the Government can
    pay enough money to and hopefully get a court to declare is safe.</p><p pid="e248.1/4">All
    that is supposed to have a deterrent effect and make the UK a less attractive
    place to seek sanctuary, but it is not working. The Bill has failed at its first
    hurdle. Clause 2 of the Bill was supposed to retrospectively apply its provisions
    to the day it was introduced to the House, <phrase class="date" code="">7 March
    2023</phrase>, and that was supposed to start to stop the boats. That was going
    to create the great deterrent effect, and it simply has not worked. The Government
    are dressing up their proposals in lieu of Lords amendment 2 as some sort of grand
    compromise, but in fact they are simply acknowledging the reality that backdating
    the Bill was not working and maintaining the clause would only create a greater
    backlog of cases for processing, at even greater expense to the public purse.</p><p
    pid="e248.1/5">Of course, it would be better if many of the powers granted, and
    duties required of the Home Secretary, by the Bill did not come into force at
    all. The Lords were not content with Lord Paddick&#8217;s amendment to decline
    to give the Bill a Second Reading when it was first debated in their House, but
    there is still an opportunity to stop this Bill, perhaps in its entirety. There
    are mechanisms through double insistence or further amendments in lieu to dramatically
    reduce, delay or even halt the provisions of this Bill.</p><p pid="e248.1/6">The
    SNP has never taken seats in the House of Lords, and I hope it never will, but
    for Opposition Members in particular who defend the role that it plays in the
    UK&#8217;s constitution, surely this is the time to call for it to play that role
    to the fullest extent. The Government have no mandate for the Bill and no mandate
    to undermine human rights agreements that have underpinned the world order since
    1945. If the Lords will not stand up on those issues, then what is even the point
    of the House of Lords? If the Government are so committed to getting this Bill
    through, they have the Parliament Acts at their disposal, or they can put their
    proposals to the public in a general election.</p><p pid="e248.1/7">However, in
    any future general election I am confident that people in Glasgow North will continue
    to vote to be part of a country and a society that recognises the duty we have
    to the poorest and most vulnerable, that reciprocates the hospitality and sanctuary
    shown to generations before us who left our country for other shores, and that
    says, &#8220;Refugees are welcome here.&#8221; If that country is not the United
    Kingdom, it will be an independent Scotland.</p><p pid="e248.1/8">Question put,

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="d712.3/1">I beg to move, That this House disagrees
    with Lords amendment 2D.</p><p pid="d712.3/2">This House has been asked these
    questions before and twice this House has said no with an overwhelming majority.
    We are asked to consider for a third time an amendment that significantly expands
    on previous versions that have already been rejected. Members of the other place
    referenced the report of the International Labour Organisation&#8217;s committee
    of experts as a reason to reconsider. However, I should note that this ground
    has already been well covered by both Houses. It was argued that Lords amendment
    2D requires Ministers to do what the ILO is requesting: to undertake consultation
    when considering introducing regulations to implement minimum service levels.
    The Bill already requires Ministers to do just that, as they have done in undertaking
    public consultations on their intentions to bring forward minimum service levels
    to passenger rail services, ambulance services and fire and rescue services. Impact
    assessments were published alongside those consultations and final impact assessments
    will be published alongside the regulations the Government bring forward for approval
    in Parliament in due course.</p><p pid="d712.3/3">My colleague Lord Callanan was
    right to say in the other place that the ILO did not say that the legislation
    was not compatible with ILO conventions. It simply said that it should be compatible
    and that we should ensure that it is. As stated in Parliament when introduced
    and throughout its passage, the Bill is compatible with the UK&#8217;s international
    obligations. The Government will continue to uphold their international obligations
    as the minimum service regulations are introduced.</p><p pid="d712.3/4">Lords
    amendment 2D also seeks to ensure that the &#8220;reasonable steps&#8221; that
    unions should take to make sure that their members comply are considered as part
    of the consultations that are required before minimum service regulations are
    made. Members will recall that when this House last considered the Bill, I confirmed
    that the Government were willing to consider whether there was a case for providing
    further detail on the reasonable steps that unions must take under new section
    234E to ensure that identified workers comply with a work notice given by an employer.
    In the light of the recommendations from the Joint Committee on Human Rights and
    points raised in both Houses during the Bill&#8217;s passage, the Government accept
    that further detail would give unions more legal certainty and foresight with
    regard to their obligations than the Bill provides in its current form. The Government
    will therefore introduce a statutory code of practice on the reasonable steps
    that must be taken, using existing powers under section 203 of the Trade Union
    and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. These powers enable the Secretary
    of State to issue a code of practice to promote the improvement of industrial
    relations.</p>'

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="c435.3/1">I beg to move, That this House disagrees
    with Lords amendments 44D, 44E, 44F, 44G, 44H and 44J.</p><p pid="c435.3/2">Let
    me begin by reminding the House that the Government have sought to make a realistic
    assessment of what we can best deliver for families more than a quarter of a century
    after the 1998 Belfast/Good Friday agreement, nearly 30 years since the first
    ceasefires, and well over 50 years since the troubles began. The backdrop is that
    current mechanisms for addressing legacy matters work for only a very small number
    of people, rather than the overwhelming majority, and established criminal justice
    processes are increasingly unlikely to deliver outcomes that people desire, especially
    in respect of prosecutions.</p><p pid="c435.3/3">We have only one issue left to
    debate today: conditional immunity. The purpose of this legislation is to give
    people more information in a shorter timeframe than is possible with the current
    mechanisms. We do that by creating an effective information recovery process that
    relies on a conditional immunity model. I attended a decent chunk of the debate
    in the House of Lords yesterday, and although I am sympathetic to the intent behind
    Lords amendment 44E, which is to give family members a role in deciding whether
    immunity should or should not be granted, immunity risks undermining the effectiveness
    of these provisions and the principal aim of information recovery. For example,
    the &#8220;public interest&#8221; consideration element in condition D would lead
    to uncertainty about the circumstances in which immunity will be granted, undermining
    the clear and transparent approach that we have developed over time. If we are
    to ensure that the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery
    can obtain as much information for families as possible, we need to ensure that
    the right incentives are in place for individuals to come forward to provide that
    information.</p>'

    than just the documents. It is about more than reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete.
    It is about more than school buildings and their safety. This debate quite simply
    is about responsibility, and whether the Prime Minister will come clean about
    the allegation that he knew the risks, that he was warned, that he was told.</p><p
    pid="c454.2/6">That is the issue in the motion before the House today: whether
    the Prime Minister was told that urgent action was needed to secure the safety
    of schools, but instead he slashed the cost of champagne; whether he will accept
    responsibility for his choices and whether he will be clear where responsibility
    lies. All of us are here with deep responsibilities to our constituents, to be
    open, to be honest, to take decisions objectively and selflessly, to accept accountability,
    to have integrity and to show leadership.</p><p pid="c454.2/7">Let me be clear
    right from the outset that a Labour Government would have shown leadership on
    this, not just in the last few weeks but for years on end. That was our record
    in government. A Labour Secretary of State, faced today with a sudden crisis such
    as this, would have got those lists of the affected schools out quickly, would
    have been straight back to London, would have been communicating every day to
    parents and above all to children, would be taking steps not just to mitigate
    the immediate challenges around safety&#8212;[Interruption.]</p>'

    in its assessment a recommendation on the appropriate legislative control of the
    substance. I thank the ACMD for the updated harms assessment that it published
    in March 2023. Its work has been helpful, and we are grateful for the time it
    spends advising the Government on this and other issues. The ACMD report did not
    recommend the control of nitrous oxide under the MDA, but it did note concerning

  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="b925.3/1">I beg to move, That this House disagrees
    with Lords amendment 102B.</p><p pid="b925.3/2">It is an honour once again to
    open the debate on this important Bill, which I am delighted to say is now so
    close to receiving Royal Assent. The Bill is a key Brexit benefit, delivering
    a simpler, more transparent procurement framework that will benefit small businesses
    and meet the needs of UK suppliers and contracting authorities.</p><p pid="b925.3/3">Colleagues
    in the Chamber will also, I hope, remember that, when the Bill was last debated
    in this House, we offered significant new measures to protect the UK&#8217;s public
    procurement supply chain from threats to national security. Those included new
    grounds to add suppliers to the debarment list for particular types of contracts
    that will allow us to ban risky suppliers from bidding for those contracts; the
    creation of a new national security unit for procurement that will provide dedicated
    resources in the Cabinet Office to scrutinise national security risks in procurement;
    and a commitment to publish a timetable for removal of surveillance equipment
    supplied by companies subject to the national intelligence law of China from Government
    Department sensitive sites. Earlier this week in the other place, we went further:
    my noble friend Baroness Neville-Rolfe provided an official clarification of the
    definition of sensitive sites and committed to an annual written report detailing
    progress. I am sure this House will welcome our additional agreements and agree
    that they demonstrate the Government&#8217;s unwavering dedication to tackle these
    issues seriously.</p><p pid="b925.3/4">I will deal today with one amendment that
    the other place sent back to this House, on the subject of organ harvesting. Let
    me begin by saying that I think all sides of this House are in complete agreement
    that organ harvesting is a dreadful practice that has no place in our supply chains.
    The question before us today is whether Lords amendment 102B is the right or necessary
    one to make, given other provisions in the Bill. In Committee in this House, the
    Government removed a discretionary exclusion ground for suppliers engaged in forced
    organ harvesting. The other place has subsequently proposed an amendment in lieu,
    with some modifications of the original amendment. This new version of the Lords
    amendment does not cover unethical activities relating to human tissue; it does,
    however, still cover forced organ harvesting and dealing in devices, equipment
    or services relating to forced organ harvesting.</p><p pid="b925.3/5">I urge this
    House to reject this amendment for a number of reasons. First, as I have said
    previously, I do not believe that the amendment is necessary as, crucially, organ
    harvesting is already dealt with under existing provisions in the Procurement
    Bill. Under the Bill, any suppliers failing to adhere to existing ethical or professional
    standards that apply in their industry, including those relating to the removal,
    storage and use of human tissue, could be excluded on the grounds of professional
    misconduct. It is worth adding at this point that, as far  as His Majesty&#8217;s
    Government are aware, no supplier in the UK public sector has been involved in
    forced organ harvesting. This means that it is very unlikely that any of our public
    money is being spent on that terrible practice. As noted above, however, if such
    a situation did arise, the exclusion for professional misconduct would apply.</p><p
    pid="b925.3/6">Secondly, the amendment has significant consequences for contracting
    authorities. It extends to suppliers</p><p class="indent" pid="b925.3/7" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;dealing
    in any device or equipment or services relating to forced organ harvesting.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="b925.3/8">That is an incredibly broad provision that would be extremely difficult
    for contracting authorities and suppliers to verify in respect of all supply chains
    and customer bases. If there were any doubt about whether that discretionary ground
    applied, local authorities or NHS trusts would need to undertake significant due
    diligence to satisfy themselves that the entire supply chain and the end user
    of all goods provided by suppliers&#8212;potentially including oxygen masks, IT
    equipment and so on&#8212;were not used in these terrible practices. It would
    mean that a small business tendering for Government contracts would need to understand
    where their customers might be using or selling their products, to enable them
    to genuinely and legitimately confirm that they were not subject to this ground.</p><p
    pid="b925.3/9">More generally, the amendment would create excessive bureaucracy,
    requiring each and every supplier bidding across the thousands of contracts awarded
    by contracting authorities each year to declare that they are not guilty of forced
    organ harvesting, when we know that there is no evidence of that horrific practice
    occurring in UK public sector supply chains. We believe that such a burden would
    be unjustified when the Bill already covers this issue.</p><p pid="b925.3/10">Thirdly,
    the Government are already taking steps to tackle the issue of organ harvesting.
    We have been explicit that the overseas organ trade, or complicity with it, will
    not be tolerated. For example, by virtue of the Health and Care Act 2022, it is
    already an offence to travel outside of the UK to purchase an organ. In addition,
    the Government continue to monitor and review evidence relating to reports of
    forced organ harvesting in China, and maintain a dialogue with leading non-governmental
    organisations and international partners on this very important issue. This Bill
    creates new rules for suppliers and contracting authorities that will hopefully
    stay on the statute book for many decades to come.</p>'

  tidied_motion: That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Scotland Act
    1998 to grant legislative competence for employment matters to the Scottish Parliament.
  full_motion_speech: '<p pid="e175.2/1">I beg to move,</p><p class="indent" pid="e175.2/2"
    pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Scotland
    Act 1998 to grant legislative competence for employment matters to the Scottish
    Parliament.</p><p pid="e175.2/3">At the outset, I draw the House&#8217;s attention
    to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests, as a member
    of the SNP trade union group and in relation to my own membership of Unite.</p><p
    pid="e175.2/4">As this Parliament begins to draw to a close, many of us are left
    wondering why the much-vaunted Employment Bill never materialised. After all,
    we were promised that Brexit&#8212;now supported enthusiastically by the Tories
    and Labour&#8212;would not lead to a diminution of workers&#8217; rights, but
    would instead be an opportunity to enhance employment protections. Despite countless
    fire and rehire incidences&#8212;many of which have been referenced by my hon.
    Friend <phrase class="honfriend" name="Gavin Newlands" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25291">the
    Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Gavin Newlands)</phrase>&#8212;ever
    more maternity discrimination and an assault on trade union rights by a Tory Government
    acting like Thatcher on steroids, the very opposite has happened.</p><p pid="e175.2/5">The
    fact is that employment rights under this British Government are under attack.
    Far from dealing with workplace discrimination on issues such as the menopause,
    we have a Government actively and increasingly hindering the rights of workers
    with their Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023. It is a piece of legislation
    that even the International Labour Organisation has expressed concern about. As
    the world of work continues to evolve and we seek to build back better from the
    pandemic, Brexit Britain is now on a steep decline when it comes to employment
    protections. However, this is an issue that extends far beyond the immediate rights
    available to workers, because it is fundamentally a matter of equality. The way
    in which we value workers in our legislative framework sets the expectation of
    what we should expect workplace cultures to emulate, and legislation must help
    build the foundations of a fair and equal labour market.</p><p pid="e175.2/6">Let
    us take, for example, some evidence published in July by the charity Pregnant
    Then Screwed. Of 24,000 parents surveyed, it was found that 7% of women lost their
    job through redundancy, sacking or feeling forced to leave due to a flexible working
    request being denied. The charity estimates that, if scaled up, this would mean
    that over 41,000 pregnant women or mothers could be sacked or made redundant every
    year. Under-represented groups continue to face significant inequalities in the
    workplace, and I and many of my colleagues have stood here time and again calling
    for the enshrinement of flexible working as a day-one right, as well as mandatory
    gender and ethnicity pay gap reporting.</p><p pid="e175.2/7">Given the powers,
    these are just some of the examples of workplace injustices that the Scottish
    Government would seek to remedy. However, it is an inescapable truth that Westminster&#8217;s
    crackdowns on workers&#8217; rights&#8212;not to mention the assault on unions&#8212;have
    seen the UK&#8217;s global rating on workers&#8217; rights fall. Indeed, the UK
    has dropped in the International Trade Union Confederation&#8217;s annual report
    on workers&#8217; rights from a  rating of three, which is for countries where
    ITUC considers there to be &#8220;regular violation of rights&#8221; to four,
    which is for those where it says there are &#8220;systemic violations&#8221;.
    Sadly, that puts the British Government on a par with the likes of Qatar and Oman.
    The latter is an absolute monarchy, where criticism of the Government is illegal.
    If that is the message the Government want to send out as Brexit Britain, it is
    certainly a bold move, but ITUC&#8217;s recent report is damning. It says:</p><p
    class="indent" pid="e175.2/8" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;In the United Kingdom,
    union busting, attempts to introduce legislation curtailing the right to strike
    and protest, and violations of collective bargaining agreements have become systematic
    and led to the country&#8217;s rating dropping from three to four.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="e175.2/9">Perhaps it is no wonder that the devolution of employment law is
    backed by some of the biggest trade unions in these islands, including the Scottish
    Trades Union Congress and the TUC itself. Only recently, the Trades Union Congress
    passed a motion calling for the repeal of current anti-union legislation and the
    devolution of employment law to Scotland. Roz Foyer, the outstanding STUC general
    secretary, is on record as saying:</p><p class="indent" pid="e175.2/10" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;It&#8217;s
    clear, especially to any incoming UK Labour Government, that the voices of workers
    across the country now support the Scottish Parliament having full autonomy over
    labour and employment rights.&#8221;</p><p pid="e175.2/11">That poses a question
    for our colleagues on the Labour Benches: why not Scotland? In his rush to out-Union
    Jack even the Secretary of State for Scotland, <phrase class="honfriend" name="Ian
    Murray" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24872">the hon. Member for Edinburgh
    South (Ian Murray)</phrase> has said no, nay, never&#8212;no further devolution.
    Today&#8217;s vote is also a first test for <phrase class="honfriend" name="Michael
    Shanks" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26276">the new hon. Member for Rutherglen
    and Hamilton West (Michael Shanks)</phrase>. It poses a question for him when
    the Division bells ring shortly: whose side is he on? Is he on the side of the
    Scottish Trades Union Congress, or the side of his Westminster boss in Camden?</p><p
    pid="e175.2/12">On blocking the devolution of employment law, <phrase class="honfriend"
    name="Angela Rayner" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25429">the right hon.
    Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner)</phrase> has come in for criticism
    from Michael Sharpe, a former general secretary of Scottish Labour, who has said
    that ruling out the devolution of employment law was a &#8220;huge blow&#8221;
    and</p><p class="indent" pid="e175.2/13" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;a slap in the
    face to the trade unions who have campaigned for this for many years.&#8221;</p><p
    pid="e175.2/14">Since taking over the reins as Labour leader, the Leader of the
    Opposition has moved ever more to the right, distancing himself from trade unions
    and, ironically, deciding to go on strike from attending picket lines himself.
    We have even had the spectre of shadow Ministers being sacked simply for having
    the temerity to support workers on a picket line.</p><p pid="e175.2/15">The blunt
    reality is that Scotland is already missing out on Europe&#8217;s enhancement
    of workers&#8217; rights, thanks to a Brexit we did not vote for and do not support.
    Post pandemic, we could have been taking opportunities to empower trade unions,
    increase statutory sick pay, ban fire and rehire, and do so much more for workers,
    but it appears once more that the Labour party and the Conservatives have landed
    in the exact same space.</p><p pid="e175.2/16">It is clear to us that a Westminster
    Government of whatever colour do not have workers&#8217; rights as a priority.
    It is only by giving Scotland powers over employment law that the Scottish Government
    can entrench workers&#8217; rights in law and build a fair work society for all
    our citizens. We can and we must do so much better for our  workers and our trade
    unions. If Westminster is not up to the job, Holyrood will take this on, and working
    people will be better off as a result. It is for that reason, and with the support
    of our trade union colleagues, that I commend this motion to the House.</p><p
